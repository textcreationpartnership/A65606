            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>'TIS but a poor Invitation to the Reader, and an uncommon way of prefacing, to tell him, that he is preſented with a Book not worth the peruſal. But as the matter is paſt Denial, and as I am certain to hear of it from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands; 'tis not ſo much Ingenuity as Policy to confeſs it. Some little Account however I think my ſelf oblig'd to give of the Motives that put me upon intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in ſo inſignificant a Debate. There is a Paſſion call'd by the <hi>Latins, Indignatio,</hi> which of all others my Nature hath left it leaſt in my Power to reſiſt. one Property of which is not to be able to behold with Patience Lions teaz'd by Gnats: If any thing can juſtifie ſuch a Paſſion in ſo little a Creature as my ſelf, the rude Inſults offered to an extraordinary Man, one of whoſe moſt
<pb facs="tcp:106337:3"/>impotent Adverſaries I have in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Papers taken upon me to bring under Examination, and the Applauſe with which the <hi>Party</hi> received them; I ſhould think will do it. What drew this <hi>Storm of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm</hi> upon that Reverend Perſon, the Reader will find not obſcurely intimated to him in the Animadverſions I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Appendix. 'Tis no wonder, that a War ſo unjuſtly begun ſhould be proſecuted by not much more Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable methods; and the <hi>Littleneſs</hi> of the Inſtruments made uſe of in executing their Revenge added to the Contumely. The Aſſurance with which their young <hi>Hero</hi> took the Field,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>B</hi> s <hi>praef</hi> p. 6.</note> that <hi>Air of Superiority</hi> with which he every where treats his Adverſary, the Acclamations with which the <hi>Party,</hi> nay the Applauſes with which he Himſelf proclaimed himſelf Conqueror, made the World begin to look upon the Dr's Caſe as deſperate; and 'twas in every Bodies mouth, Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Book is an unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble piece. Nor was it enough, that Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> had poſted his <hi>deſpiſed</hi> Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> at the top of <hi>two hundred and ninety</hi> Pages; that he had made him the Jeſt and Sting of I know not how many <hi>thouſand</hi> Periods, the Common Chat of <hi>Coffee-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Taverns:</hi> He threatens him with yet more diſmal things to follow:
<pb facs="tcp:106337:3"/>That there ſhould be a Book written againſt him in <hi>Latin;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 229.</note> that Foreign <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities ſhould in due time be informed, what a Man the King of <hi>England</hi> had to his <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary-Keeper;</hi> and particularly Monſieur <hi>Spanheim,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Graevius</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed how to chuſe out ſome more <hi>deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> Perſon to <hi>place their Civilities up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Nay, and,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 289.290.</note> to put him beyond all Hopes, he plainly tells him, that he was fallen into the Hands of an whole <hi>Body of Men,</hi> whoſe Hatreds and Revenges were <hi>Immortal; who when once they begin with a Man, there's no knowing when they will leave him;</hi> and who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to uſe him as unmercifully with their Pens, as ever <hi>Phalaris</hi> did poor Innocents with his <hi>Muſical</hi> Bull.</p>
            <p>Had not the Dr. been either very Conſcious to himſelf of the Goodneſs of his Cauſe, or very inſenſible of Danger, he would tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have quitted the Field, and have ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Patience and Silence to have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated their Diſpleaſure. But to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of the <hi>Town</hi> it was ſoon got abroad, that the Dr. did not <hi>yield;</hi> nay, that he did but Laugh at them, and would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly give them an Anſwer. This, we may ſuppoſe, created them ſome Diſturbance. For I cannot imagine, that they did ever in their Hearts believe Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> to be
<pb facs="tcp:106337:4"/>ſo very manageable an Adverſary as in their Writings they had every where repreſented him. However, one conſiderable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they had gained in their firſt Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The <hi>Town</hi> and common Fame were on their ſide, which when once they have fallen in with a falſe Cry will not eaſily change their Note. Supported with this Comfort, they were reſolv'd to ſtand their ground, and if the Dr. was for anſwering them, they would be ſure to find him work enough. I very well remember, that ſome Months before the Dr's laſt Book was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, I heard it in theſe very Words and Syllables from a certain Perſon, whom I ſuppoſe no ſtranger to the Secrets of the Party; <q>Let the Dr. come out with his Anſwer as ſoon as he will, they are in a readineſs for him; to my certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſaith he, they have <hi>Rods in Piſs</hi> againſt him.</q> Accordingly, within not many Weeks after the Dr's Anſwer was publiſhed (but juſt time enough for the Club to patch up Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Appendix) it was followed by this <hi>Rod in Piſs</hi> of a Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: as indeed well it might, all the Sheets (or I am miſ-informed) being wrought off before. And here was another piece of work for the Dr. wherein they had him upon an unlucky <hi>Dilemma.</hi> If he anſwered it, the <hi>Littleneſs</hi> of the Subject, as well as the
<pb facs="tcp:106337:4"/>inequality of the Antagoniſt, muſt needs have expoſed him to Contempt: If he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered it not; that had been interpreted a ſubmitting to the Charge, and would have kept ſome Life in the Cauſe. And again; if he anſwered This, they might have had another piece againſt him, and after That another; and after That another, and ſo on; verifying Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Prediction, that there were an <hi>whole Body</hi> engaged againſt him, <hi>who when once they begin with a Man, there's no knowing when they will leave him.</hi> Nay, I have heard it more than once, that they gave out, they would write a Book againſt him once a Month as long as he liv'd. Nay, and I can produce my Witneſſes, to whom Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> hearing, it ſeems, that there was ſomething of an Anſwer deſigned to the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator,</hi> ſaid with his own mouth; That they were beſt let his <hi>Appendix</hi> alone: If they Printed any <hi>Reflections</hi> upon him, he'd be even with them, and have them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed all the Town over, both in <hi>Verſe</hi> and <hi>Proſe.</hi> And theſe are the Methods by which the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> are reſolved to humble the <hi>Library-Keeper</hi> at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and terrifie the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from opening their Lips on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106337:5"/>
            <p>And muſt therefore Men and Books, like Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Books, be run down meerly by noiſe and numbers? Shall Banter ſo ſecurely Triumph over Learning, and Phraſe and Confidence over Senſe and Truth? Muſt Men of Worth (as I think, I have ſomewhere or other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt it in the following Papers) be made the mock of Fools, becauſe they that make them ſo write things ſo wretchedly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, that a Man who hath any regard to his own Reputation, would be aſhamed of having ſo miſ-employ'd his time as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them?</p>
            <p>As 'twas this Conſideration, and this only, drew me into this Diſpute; ſo I muſt deſire the Reader to conſider, that 'tis not the Subject-matter of the following Lines which I recommend to his Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the manner of theſe Gentlemens managing their Controverſie with Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</hi> And becauſe it is ſcarce to be hoped that many ſhould be found, who will give themſelves the trouble of examining every particular, I ſhall point out ſome few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of our Vindicator's Allegations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dr. by which the Reader may give a gueſs at the whole, which upon Tryal I can aſſure him, he will find all of a piece. The chief Deſign of the <hi>Vindicator's</hi> Book, is to charge the Dr. with <hi>Plagiariſm</hi> upon
<pb facs="tcp:106337:5"/>account of a certain MS. from whence it is pretended Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> borrowed a great part of his Collection of the Fragments of <hi>Callimachus</hi> publiſhed in Mr. <hi>Graevius</hi>'s late Edition of that Author, and put them off for his <hi>own.</hi> As I may pretend to have examined this part of his Accuſation, more nicely than I can expect many others will do, I <hi>ſincerely declare,</hi> that I ſee not the leaſt Reaſon to believe, that the Dr's Collection was one line or hint the richer for his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen that MS. The true State of the Controverſie is given in the firſt Sheet and half, ending at page <hi>23.</hi> To which, he that ſhall have the Curioſity of going to the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> and collating the Original E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence it ſelf there to be ſhewn againſt the Dr. is deſired to add the <hi>Cautions</hi> laid down, page <hi>51, &amp;c.</hi> If he would without loſing the time of going over the whole ſee ſome particular Exemplifications of our Vindicator's Ingenuity in proſecuting his Charge againſt the Dr. and of the Validity of his <hi>Proofs,</hi> he may conſult theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſages. <hi>Remark</hi> the firſt upon <hi>Proofs 6, 7.</hi> p. <hi>25.</hi> and p. <hi>33.62, 63.116, 117, 118.</hi> and eſpecially, p. <hi>79.80.81.86.</hi> As for a choice Obſervation of our Vindicator's (though indeed not his <hi>own,</hi> but taken up at ſecond hand from Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>) upon the Extent of the Dr's Reading, I referr him
<pb facs="tcp:106337:6"/>to p. <hi>37, &amp;c.</hi> He that would take the meaſure of his <hi>Learning</hi> and Judgment, will find it, as in all his moſt judicious Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon the Dr's pretended miſtakes, ſo more eſpecially in theſe <hi>Obſervations</hi> of his <hi>own,</hi> p. <hi>88, 89.91, 92.102, &amp;c.</hi> and in his <hi>Supplement,</hi> p. <hi>120, &amp;c. 125.128, &amp;c.</hi> And here let me give (which was omitted in its proper place) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of thoſe two <hi>Greek</hi> Lines, pag. <hi>89.</hi> by the help of which even the <hi>Wits</hi> and the <hi>Fools of Parts</hi> (who are indeed the ſupport of the Cauſe) may be able, without the help of more Learning than what their Mother tongue affords them, to give ſome gueſs at the profundity of our <hi>Vindicator's</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and how proper a Perſon he is to ſet up for a Corrector of other Men's Writings; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> According to <hi>Stephanus,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Emendation in <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus. <hi>I alſo, as well as</hi> Pythagoras, <hi>command you to abſtain from the feeding upon Beans, or the Fleſh of any living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> But according to our Learned <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator's</hi> Correction thus. <hi>I alſo, as well as</hi> Pythagoras, <hi>command you to abſtain from feeding upon Beans, and that</hi> you ſit ſtill without ſpeaking a word.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Veracity</hi> of our <hi>Honeſt</hi> Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator, his whole Book is one continued Proof of it. The very Deſign of his Book
<pb facs="tcp:106337:6"/>being to prove; that the Dr. ſtole the beſt part of his Collection from their MS.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Appendix being about that <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> which hath fill'd the mouths of the <hi>Party</hi> with ſuch Clamours, if any thing I have written ſhall find a Reader, I may preſume it will be my Examination of that <hi>Appendix;</hi> to which therefore I ſhall not here ſay any more, than that I am even <hi>amazed</hi> at Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Confidence in concluding his Appendix with ſo ſerious and ſolemn a Proteſtation,<note place="margin">P. 133.</note> That thoſe things were written <hi>by him with the ſame</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, <hi>and</hi> Care <hi>as if he had been upon his</hi> Oath; <hi>that he had no where made uſe of any</hi> falſe Colours, <hi>nor willingly miſlead his Readerin any the leaſt trifling Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of that tedious Story.</hi> Which, taking his words in the plain and natural Senſe they ſeem to Deſign, I dare pronounce, to be a <hi>moſt notorious Falſhood.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THAT part of your Book which I have now under conſideration bears this Title.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An Honeſt Vindication of</hi> Tho. Stanley, <hi>Eſquire, and his Notes on</hi> Callimachus. <hi>To which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome other <hi>Obſervations</hi> on that Poet. In a Letter to the Honourable</hi> Charles Boyle, <hi>Eſquire. With a <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> in relation to Dr.</hi> Bentley<hi>'s late Book <hi>againſt</hi> him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Title promiſes two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> An <hi>Honeſt Vindication</hi> of <hi>Tho. Stanley,</hi> Eſquire, and his Notes on <hi>Callimachus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106337:9"/>
            <p>But withal here is ſpecial care taken to give the Reader notice of a certain <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s late Book <hi>againſt</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle:</hi> by which late Book of Dr. <hi>Bentley a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> I underſtand the Doctor's late Book in Vindication of Himſelf, and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation upon the Epiſtles of <hi>Phalaris</hi> from the Objections made by the Honourable <hi>Charles Boyle,</hi> Eſquire, <hi>againſt</hi> Both</p>
            <p>Though 'tis your <hi>Honeſt</hi> Vindication of Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> and his <hi>Notes</hi> on <hi>Callimachus</hi> I am prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally concerned with: yet ſince you have been pleas'd to bleſs the world with ſome Things of your <hi>Own;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 34. lin. 7.</note> Thoſe your <hi>own</hi> Obſervations I ſhall ſeparate from thoſe of Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> and, to make them the more obſerved, preſent them to the view of the Reader in a place by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And as for the <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> it will give me as little trouble, as I believe it did you.</p>
            <p>That the Vindication of the Dead,<note place="margin">P. 25.</note> and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them who cannot ſpeak for themſelves, is a Generous and Honourable Undertaking, I freely grant you. But if this <hi>Vindication</hi> of the Dead was wholly Unneceſſary; if there was not the leaſt manner of Injuſtice offered by Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> to the <hi>Manes</hi> of Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> requiring ſuch a Vindication;<note place="margin">P. 74.</note> the Doctor never omitting the mention of his Name, where there was juſt occaſion for it, nor ever mentioning it without the regard due to his Merit;<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tley</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mr. <hi>Boyle, pref.</hi> p. <hi>93.</hi> p. <hi>232. &amp; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. ad fin.

               </note> if this your <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> of the Dead be in reality nothing elſe than an <hi>Accuſation</hi> of the Living, and that <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation</hi> altogether frivolous, falſe and malicious; if upon due Examination this ſhould appear to be the truth of the caſe: an indifferent Reader will be much tempted to doubt, whether or no
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106337:9"/>in the whole management of this Affair you were indeed acted by thoſe noble Principles you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs of Conſcience, Honour, and Religion,<note place="margin">Pref. <hi>p.</hi> 1, 2, <hi>and</hi> P. 25, 76, 77.</note> and not rather put upon it by ſome very unjuſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Motives of a quite different Nature. As perhaps the mean <hi>view</hi> of making your Court (though at the Expence both of your own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and your Neighbours Good Name) to a Young Gentleman,<note place="margin">P. 54.</note> or the <hi>vain-glorious</hi> Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of falling in with a Triumphant Party and dividing with them the Spoils of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>already</hi> (as you too ſoon thought) conquer'd Enemy.</p>
            <p>But the Controverſie in which I am engaged is too trifling to bear the Solemnity of an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. I ſhall therefore without farther Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony forthwith enter into the Merits of the Cauſe; which I hope in not many words to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch with that Clearneſs and Evidence, that even you your ſelf ſhall be willing to let the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter drop, and wiſh it had never been ſtarted.</p>
            <p>To try the force of your Allegations againſt Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> upon the account of Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s MS. I ſhall begin with the firſt of them,<note place="margin">Callimach. op. Edit. Graevian p. <hi>305.</hi> Vindicator. p. <hi>34.</hi> Harpocrat. Suidas.</note> and under that plead to the whole Indictment.</p>

            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>This Citation out of</hi> Suidas (<hi>which Mr.</hi> Stanley <hi>only</hi> hinted <hi>at</hi>) <hi>the Doctor hath</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>and printed in words at length.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are your words. By the <hi>Parentheſis</hi> here (<hi>which Mr.</hi> Stanley <hi>only hinted at</hi>) is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, I ſuppoſe, that if Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> had not <hi>hinted</hi> at it, Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> had not <hi>tranſcribed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have you drawn up the Charge, which reduced into form lies thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Citations out of</hi> Harpocration <hi>and</hi> Suidas <hi>are in Mr.</hi> Stanley.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The Citations out of</hi> Harpocration <hi>and</hi> Suidas <hi>are in Dr.</hi> Bentley: ergo,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dr.</hi> Bentley <hi>ſtole the Citations out of</hi> Harpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration <hi>and</hi> Suidas <hi>from Mr.</hi> Stanley.</p>
            <p>Now of the ſelf ſame ſtamp are all and every one of your Proofs that follow; as thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Citations,</hi> Num. 2, 3, 7, 8, 12. <hi>and ſo of the reſt, are in Mr.</hi> Stanley.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Citations,</hi> Num. 2, 3, 7, 8, 12, <hi>&amp;c. are in Dr.</hi> Bentley: ergo,</p>

            <p>Thus lies your Argument, nor can you ſay, but that I give it its whole force.</p>
            <p>And theſe are thoſe <hi>Proofs,</hi> to which you give the <hi>Epithet</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndeniable,</hi> and upon which you pronounce the Doctor a <hi>Convict</hi> of <hi>Notorious</hi> Plagiariſm.<note place="margin">P. 76.</note> Were I minded to expreſs my ſelf <hi>ingeniouſly</hi> upon this occaſion, I could not do it in better words than in thoſe of an <hi>Approved</hi> Author, for whom you doubtleſs have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Eſteem. <hi>Either our</hi> Vindicator <hi>muſt be a very Thoughtleſs Writer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> B. <hi>p.</hi> 259.</note> 
               <hi>or he muſt hope to meet with very Thoughtleſs Readers; and ſuch I am ſure they muſt be, if this way of arguing paſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</hi> Never was that bold <hi>Epithet, Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable,</hi> more miſerably abuſed in the Preſs, or placed in a Poſt where it could leſs maintain its Ground. But it hath been the peculiar Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ſome Books to meet with <hi>very Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Readers.</hi> Nor can I imagine what other Conſideration could have given our <hi>Honeſt Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator</hi> alſo the Heart to ſet up for an Author. I could pinch you ſomewhat cloſe upon this your <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndeniable.</hi> But I ſcorn to take a weak Enemy at Advantage. That would be a Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106337:10"/>to the cauſe I have in hand: and Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> might well think himſelf a man as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy in his Advocate, as he is happy in his Adverſary, were this the beſt defence I could make for him, that your Proofs againſt him are <hi>not</hi> Undeniable. No, Sir, I'll freely abate you that ſtrong word. If you can but make them, even to the loweſt degree of Probability, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;</hi> I'll allow you a little heightning of your Stile, and you ſhall call them <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndeniable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Probability of your Proofs depends upon the Probability of the <hi>Suppoſition</hi> upon which they ſtand: and that Suppoſition is this; That Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> never met with thoſe <hi>Citations</hi> which you charge upon him as ſtoln from Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s MS. either in the Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in whoſe Names they are publiſh'd, or in any other Book whatſoever, ſave in your MS. For had he met with them any where elſe, he might as well have <hi>tranſcribed</hi> them from thence as from your MS.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> B. <hi>p.</hi> 101, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Now to ſuppoſe this redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the <hi>induſtrious</hi> Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s <hi>Polymathy</hi> and <hi>multifarious</hi> Reading into a very narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. Or elſe you muſt ſuppoſe, that though he might have met with them elſewhere, yet he would never have <hi>obſerved</hi> them, ſo as to have drawn them together, and preſented them to the World in the manner he hath done, had he not found them readily collected to his hands by Mr. <hi>Stanley;</hi> which to prove will put you as hard to it as the former.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conceſſ.</hi> 8.9, infr. <hi>p.</hi> 11, 12.</note> This I think is a clear caſe. So that the Controverſie depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us is plainly this. Whether it be more probable that the Doctor ſhould have both <hi>ſeen</hi> and <hi>obſerved</hi> thoſe Citations in ſome other Books beſides your MS. which is that part of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106337:11"/>the Queſtion I take. Or, whether it be more probable, that he had never <hi>met</hi> with them any where elſe, or never would have <hi>obſerved</hi> them, had not your MS either preſented him with them in words at length, or at leaſt <hi>directed</hi> him to the Books where he might find them; which is the point you are to maintain.</p>
            <p>Having thus, I think, very fairly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtated the Caſe, and as much as poſſibly could be done to your advantage; let us calmly and deliberately argue it out. In the doing of which, for method ſake, I ſhall proceed in this Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall produce your <hi>own,</hi> and your Friends <hi>Conceſſions</hi> on behalf of the Doctor.</p>
            <p>Then I ſhall compare your <hi>Conceſſions</hi> with your <hi>Aſſertions,</hi> and from thence raiſe ſome juſt and reaſonable Exceptions deeply affecting the whole Body of your Proofs. Which being, in the laſt place, applied to the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I ſhall think this Controverſie at an end.</p>
            <p>But this one thing I muſt obſerve to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I go any farther, that hitherto I am but upon the <hi>Defenſive,</hi> nor as yet any farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Doctor's intereſts, than barely to diſcharge him of the Accuſation you bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; ſo that I am willing to ſtand upon the very <hi>loweſt</hi> Terms with you, and ſhall be content to take up with that <hi>indifferent</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Doctor, which you and your Friends are pleaſed to give me, and make the beſt I can of it.</p>
            <p>To begin therefore with your <hi>Conceſſions.</hi> And here I am forced to <hi>Subpoena</hi> in two or three Witneſſes for the Doctor, whoſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies will be of ſo much the greater weight in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106337:11"/>this cauſe, by how much the leſs they can be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of Partiality in his Favour. As for that Honourable Gentleman, whoſe name I muſt ſomewhat often make uſe of upon this occaſion, conſidering how neceſſary his evidence is to me, and ho will I could have ſpared it, I hope he will the more readily pardon my preſumption in producing it.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106337:17"/>the Doctor's Reading, that he would certainly have miſs'd of them, had he not found them in your MS. of which I ſay the ſame as of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; the Citations of Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s MS. being the moſt eaſily come at of any in the whole Set, and lying ſo full in the Doctor's daily walks, that he could not but have ſtumbled upon them, even whether he would or no. And yet you run on from the beginning to the end upon your wild and groundleſs <hi>Suppoſition,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sup.</hi> p. 5.</note> which you take for granted, without offering one Syllable in proof of it, That the Doctor had never <hi>met</hi> with thoſe Citations any where elſe, or never <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> them, till he lit upon them in your MS. This is that grand <hi>Suppoſition</hi> which ſupports all your Proofs: which therefore, when upon a Review of the Conceſſions before laid down, you ſhall ſee ſo miſerably betray'd, you will find cauſe to blame your own Incircumſpection, and wiſh you had been more ſparing of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements.</p>
                  <p>And now Sir, as for the Promiſe which I made you of a compariſon between your <hi>Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> and your <hi>Aſſertions;</hi> I think I may ſave my ſelf that labour, and leave it to the Reader from what hath been already ſaid to collect how far thoſe Liberal <hi>Encomiums</hi> beſtow'd upon the Doctor for his Induſtry, and the ſeveral other peculiarities of his character, ſo happily quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying him for Undertakings of this nature, will go to diſcharge him of the foul Imputation of <hi>Plagiariſm;</hi> and how inconſiſtent the one part of the character you give us of him is with the other part of it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not for that the neceſſity of the cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires this Precaution and Exactneſs, that I am
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106337:17"/>thus grave, and (if I may ſo ſay) <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> in making my <hi>Approaches</hi> to the Argument, but out of the reſpect I bear to your perſon, whom being altogether unknown to me, I would not willingly Affront; which conſtruction might be made of it, ſhould I anſwer your Suggeſtions in ſo ſlighty and ſuperficial a manner, as if they did not deſerve a more thorow Conſideration. And beſides, thoſe ſo <hi>Emphatick</hi> terms in which you preſs on your Accuſation upon the Doctor, will plead my excuſe, if I be at more pains than otherwiſe could have been judged neceſſary to beſtow upon it ſo <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>operoſe</hi> a Reply. <hi>Undeniable Proof, Ocular Demonſtration, matter of Fact, Manifeſt Conviction:</hi> Theſe, ſure, are too weighty things to be paſs'd over with a looſe Harangue.

                  </p>
                  <p>And thus much for the <hi>Exceptions</hi> I had to make againſt your Proofs, all of them founded upon your own <hi>Conceſſions;</hi> which you cannot in honour retract: though indeed you have given little more than what I might honeſtly have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed for the Doctor without becoming your Debtor. But ſince you were ſo over and above obliging, I was willing to cloſe in with you upon your own Terms. Eſpecially moſt of thoſe things being delivered with ſuch a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Gracefulneſs and Decency of <hi>Stile,</hi> which my unpractis'd Pen could never have attain'd to. Nor can you now ſay, that I have any-where
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106337:19"/>abuſed or miſrepreſented you, having all along recited your own Words and Syllables, put no forc'd Interpretation upon them; nor charged them with conſequences which they do not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally bear. And 'tis but agreeable to the Law of Arms, if one can make ones ſelf Maſter of the Enemy's Artillery, to turn it upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and if your Teſtimonies <hi>for</hi> the Doctor muſt be of no weight; 'Tis a moſt unequitable demand, that your Teſtimonies <hi>againſt</hi> him ſhould be of greater.

                  <p>There are ſome ſorts of Tranſactions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Preliminaries rightly adjuſted, the whole Affair is ſoon brought to a Concluſion: of which kind I take to be our preſent Controverſie.

And now let us ſee how deeply the Doctor is endebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your MS. upon the account of theſe two Quotations. Juſt thus much and no more. Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> he ſends him to <hi>Parrhaſius;</hi> and <hi>Parrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> he ſends him to <hi>Rome,</hi> telling him withall, that 'twas but going into the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, and enquiring there for a certain <hi>old nameleſs</hi> Scholiaſt <hi>upon</hi> Homer; and ſo, if he had the luck to hit upon the right Book, he would meet with ſomewhat to his purpoſe in it: And ſo the Doctor came by his two Citations out of <hi>Didymus.</hi> An <hi>Information</hi> much like that which the old man in the Fable gave to his Son of a Treaſure buried under ground in the Vineyard, but not telling him the place where, the young
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106337:21"/>Heir was fain to dig the Vineyard all over, and ſo he found his Treaſure indeed, not what he expected, Pots of Money, but what his Father deſigned, the fruit of good Husbandry. After the ſame manner, the Dr. having (by the help of your MS.) heard ſomewhat of an old <hi>Scholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſt</hi> upon <hi>Homer,</hi> that quoted ſomewhat out of <hi>Callimachus</hi> his <hi>Aetia,</hi> was reſolv'd, whatever it was, and whatever pains it coſt him, he would have it. But that <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> upon <hi>Homer</hi> being a <hi>nameleſs</hi> one, leaſt he ſhould not hit upon the right, he turns over all the <hi>Scholiaſts</hi> upon <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi> and ſo he gets not only theſe three Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions belonging to <hi>Callimachus</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">

For had not your MS. ſent him to <hi>Janus Parrhaſius,</hi> the Doctor had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought of any of the <hi>old Scholiaſts</hi> upon <hi>Homer.</hi> But to be ſerious with you, Sir; would you have offer'd ſuch things as theſe for <hi>Proofs</hi> againſt the Doctor, but upon the preſumption that no body would have been at the pains of tracing you? The Doctor is a <hi>Notorious Plagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi> And why? why, <hi>becauſe</hi> the Doctor hath three Quotations out of <hi>Didymus</hi> upon <hi>Homer,</hi> referring to <hi>Callimachus</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">

Or would not <hi>Gruter</hi>'s <hi>Index,</hi> which <hi>literâ C.</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>Callimachi Aetia, quo argumento Parrhaſ.</hi> p. 873. have ſent him as ſtrait to <hi>Parrhaſius</hi> as your MS. could have done? Or are you ſure that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaſius</hi> his <hi>old nameleſs Scholiaſt</hi> of the <hi>Vatican</hi> was ever yet committed to the Preſs? or that <hi>Didymus</hi> was it? For there are ſeveral old <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſts</hi> upon <hi>Homer</hi> both printed and in MS. As beſides <hi>Euſtathius</hi> and <hi>Didymus,</hi> whom every body hath heard of, <hi>Gruter</hi>'s Index to the 5th Volume of his <hi>Criticks</hi> refers me to <hi>H. Stephani Schediaſmata, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 21. where I find menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Quaedam in Homerum Scholia, quae nondum edita ſunt, &amp; quae quàm pauciſſimis legere datur.</hi> In the Epiſtle printed at the end of <hi>Malela</hi>'s Chronology, <hi>p.</hi> 63. I find the Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf quoting <hi>Joannes Tzetzes</hi> his <hi>Ilias interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Allegoricè, quae nondum edita eſt.</hi> And in <hi>num.</hi> 135. of this his Collection, I find him produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a Fragment of <hi>Callimachus</hi> with a large Quotation out of <hi>Porphyrius in Homericis Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionibus.</hi> And theſe indeed have been printed over and over, but in <hi>Holſtenius</hi> his Notes upon <hi>Porphyry</hi>'s Life of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> you will find men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other old <hi>Scholia</hi> upon <hi>Homer,</hi> bearing alſo the name of <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> which have never been yet printed. And other old MS. <hi>Scholia</hi> upon <hi>Homer</hi> undoubtedly there are in the world more than either you, or I, or the Dr. or Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> or <hi>Parrhaſius,</hi> or any one man elſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106337:23"/>may have ſeen. Now to which of all theſe did <hi>Parrhaſius</hi> ſend the Doctor? To that which is now known by the name of <hi>Didymus</hi> you ſuppoſe, but it might be to any other <hi>name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Scholiaſt</hi> as well as to him I might farther ask you, Sir, how many Quotations out of all or any one of theſe <hi>Scholiaſts</hi> are there in your MS? In the Doctor's Collection, taking them all together, there are (for I have been at the pains of counting them) above half an hundred Quotations out of the old <hi>Scholiaſts</hi> upon <hi>Homer.</hi> As far as you have carried on the compariſon, I find not ſo much as one ſingle reference direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of your MS. to any one of all theſe <hi>Scholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſts,</hi> and therefore very much queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the drawing up this <hi>Imperfect Draught</hi> Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> made any uſe of any one of them. And yet by a ſtrange fetch theſe three <hi>Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> muſt be ſtole from your MS. But if he came by theſe three by the help of your MS. how came he by the other half hundred? were they from your MS too? a <hi>compendious</hi> way of making him as <hi>Notorious</hi> a <hi>Plagiary</hi> as you pleaſe. For you might as well have charged him with the whole as with part. And do ſuch <hi>Proofs</hi> as theſe deſerve a better anſwer than what I gave them? <hi>Not Proofs,</hi> nor any thing like <hi>Proofs,</hi> but mere Suggeſtion, and altogether groundleſs. And now as for that <hi>Sentence</hi> out of <hi>Parrhaſius</hi> with which, as it were by way of <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> you back theſe two <hi>Proofs,</hi> and by the help of which tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> you call the Doctor <hi>Plagiary</hi> in two Languages, I have no more to ſay to it, than that I believe the <hi>Tranſtation</hi> to be your <hi>own:</hi> which is more than I dare venture to ſay for that choice piece
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106337:24"/>of an <hi>Aeſopick,</hi> which adorns your Title-page. There ſeems to be too much of the Spirit and Stile in that for a perſon of your Gravity and Seriouſneſs. I am almoſt as confident as if I had ſeen the hand that did it; that in your <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-page</hi> and <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> you had the aſſiſtance of ſome Second. 'Twas pity he did not take the ſame care of you throughout your whole Book. Your <hi>Stile</hi> ſtood in great need of mending. I fear I have already detained the Reader too long upon this particular. But I was willing to let him ſee how reſolved you were to make the moſt of your Cauſe. And Remark the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, as for another inſtance of your plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a bold ſtroak of the Pen, he'll find not at all inferiour to the firſt; but (as to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of it at leaſt) of a more general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>

But this Paragraph is <hi>fruitfull</hi> of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of a more important conſideration. I ſhall deliver them as ſuccinctly as I can; yet ſo as to make my ſelf throughly underſtood, and ſet things in a full Light.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then I obſerve that we are but juſt got over two of your <hi>Proofs</hi> againſt the Dr. (<hi>ſc.</hi> the <hi>Quotations</hi> out of <hi>Harpocration</hi> and <hi>Suidas</hi>) but that he matches them with two <hi>Additions</hi> of his own, (<hi>ſc.</hi> the two <hi>Epigrams</hi> out of the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology</hi>) to the one of which the new <hi>Authority</hi> added makes the Dr's <hi>ſome</hi> Additions, Three; to this ſuppoſed <hi>Plagiariſms,</hi> Two. You ſee, Sir, you have loſt ground at the <hi>ſtarting-Poſt,</hi> and I dare ſay you'll be diſtanc'd out and out e'er you reach half the <hi>Courſe.</hi> I might far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerve that this new <hi>Authority</hi> produced by the Dr. (which if any body had done before him, 'tis more than I know) for part of one of theſe <hi>Epigrams,</hi> gives it with ſomething of difference in the reading from that of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology.</hi> 'Tis true, that difference is not in this place very material, the ſenſe in both coming to the ſame And yet this cannot be ſaid to be an Inſignificancy; ſince though not here, yet in many other places the ſame <hi>Fragments</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106337:25"/>out of ſeveral Authors, what from the variety of the <hi>Lections,</hi> and other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is reſcued from that obſcurity in which it muſt otherwiſe for ever have remained unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible. And this is a caſe which happens ſo very often in the Dr's Collection, that there are but few Pages, which afford not inſtances of it in abundance; proving at the ſame time the compaſs of his Reading, and the exactneſs of his Judgment. Or however if any one ſhould (as none that underſtands any thing in Affairs of this nature will) cenſure this multiplying of Authorities to the ſame purpoſe for a vain and fruitleſs Curioſity: yet at leaſt it clears him from the Imputation of <hi>Plagiariſm.</hi> For if in ſome, nay in many places, the Dr. and your MS. fall in with the ſame <hi>Quotations:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Supr. p. <hi>17.</hi>
                        </note> that, as hath been before ſaid, the nature of the thing renders im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to have been otherwiſe: But if your MS. produces a Fragment atteſted (as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the caſe) with only one <hi>Authority,</hi> or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe two, and the Dr. adds one, two, or three more; how is he a Plagiary? if he could out of his own Stores produce four, three, two, nay or but one <hi>Authority</hi> to which your MS. dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him not; why may we not ſuppoſe him as able to have produced thoſe other alſo which are to be ſeen <hi>in</hi> your MS?

This is ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious a Reflection, that upon ſecond thought you cannot but blame your own Indiſcretion in laying it ſo full in view.

                     <p>This Article of the Dr's <hi>ſome</hi> Additions I look'd upon to be a moſt material point, and ſuch wherein the very ſubſtance of the cauſe is very nearly concern'd; and therefore gladly laid hold on the firſt opportunity of conſidering it ſomewhat particularly.</p>
                     <p>At the beginning of this <hi>Remark,</hi> I made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>bold ſtroke of the Pen,</hi> and what that is we ſhall ſee in the obſervation I am now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon.

                     <p>I obſerve therefore, that the other Book, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>Anthology,</hi> out of which the Dr. fetches part of one of theſe <hi>Epigrams,</hi> is that <hi>known</hi> Lexicographer, <hi>Suidas;</hi> nay, but <hi>Suidas</hi> in the <hi>Letter</hi>

                     <p>This Undertaking therefore of collecting the <hi>Fragments</hi> of <hi>Callimachus</hi> I have reaſon to ſuſpect was not with that Learned Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi>

                     <p>His firſt Eſſays toward this work appear in thoſe Papers with which you make ſuch a ſtir, which were once (without his ſeeking) put into the Dr's hand, and which are now put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>other</hi> hands to be <hi>ſhewn</hi> as Evidence againſt the Dr. at the ſign of the <hi>Half Moon</hi> in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard.<note place="margin">Sup. p. <hi>14.</hi>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> therefore having once entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this deſign of Collecting the <hi>Fragments</hi> of <hi>Callimachus,</hi> he doth, as upon the like occaſion another man would have done; that is, he fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in his <hi>firſt</hi> Materials from ſuch places where they were the moſt readily found: he turns o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Indices Authorum</hi> at the end of ſeveral<note n="*" place="margin">

There was not any one Author more proper to his purpoſe than <hi>Suidas.</hi> But <hi>Suidas</hi> having no <hi>Index Authorum</hi> annexed to him, with him Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> begins, and turns over all that <hi>Lexicographer</hi> himſelf fro the beginning to the end: as for the reſt contenting himſelf, for a time, with what the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dexes</hi> ſupply'd him with. This I confeſs is mere <hi>Conjecture:</hi> but a <hi>Conjecture</hi> ſo manifeſtly founded upon <hi>matter of fact,</hi> that I dare boldly pronounce it next to a Certainty: and whether I am too confident, I ſhall ſubmit to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reader upon an inſtance or two by and by to be produced. Now Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> having taken this courſe with <hi>Suidas</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, it is impoſſible but that the far greateſt part of the Quotations out of <hi>Suidas</hi> in the Dr's Collection ſhould have been anticipated by Mr. <hi>Stanley.</hi> And had that Learned Gentleman in theſe Papers of his taken the ſame courſe with many other Authors, you would have had, though not more of <hi>Truth,</hi> yet a better <hi>Colour</hi> for your Accuſation. But if you will ſtill reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely maintain it, that the Dr. having ſeen your MS. therefore all the Quotations out of <hi>Suidas</hi> in the Dr's Collection ſhall have been <hi>tranſcribed</hi> from Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> I know not how to clear my ſelf of you, but by the help of a <hi>Diſtinction.</hi> And this <hi>Diſtinction</hi> of mine, Sir, I deſire you well to conſider, and withal to remember, that it will perform the ſame upon any other Author, as upon <hi>Suidas:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106337:31"/>though <hi>Suidas</hi> be the name we are here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet the Argument extends to the whole body of the cauſe: which will excuſe me in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the more particularly upon it.</p>
                     <p>Of the Quotations out of <hi>Suidas</hi> therefore I obſerve ſome of them to ſtand in that <hi>Lexicon</hi> with the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Callimachus</hi> affixed to them in words at length: others of them to contain ſome <hi>Fragments</hi> of that <hi>Poet,</hi> or to refer to ſome paſſages in him, but without expreſs mention of his <hi>Name.</hi> Thoſe of this <hi>later</hi> ſort (as they are not numerous) I will be at the pains of mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to you; <hi>viz.</hi> one Quotation, <hi>Num.</hi> 2. one of the Quotations (<hi>ſc.</hi> that <hi>v.</hi>

Now, Sir, there are in the Dr's Collection (as far as you have carried on the compariſon, that is from <hi>Num.</hi> 1. to <hi>Num.</hi> 103. in all about thirty <hi>Quotations</hi> out of <hi>Suidas,</hi> to every one of which, ſaving thoſe in the <hi>Numbers</hi> here mention'd, you will find added the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Callimachus</hi> ſtanding in words at length: and every one of thoſe <hi>Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> to which the <hi>Name</hi> of their Author is ſo added, I find you charging upon the Dr. as ſtoln from Mr. <hi>Stanley;</hi> that ſingle one <hi>v.</hi>

                        </gap>, Dr. <hi>B. p.</hi> 352. excepted, though even <hi>that</hi> alſo (however by you omitted) I am apt to believe upon further ſearch would be found in your MS. But of theſe latter ſort, which have <hi>not</hi> the Name of <hi>Callimachus</hi> ſo added to them, I do not find you mentioning any ſingle <hi>one</hi> of them as taken from Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> and therefore have ſome Reaſon to ſuſpect that Learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to have overlook'd them. Upon this point I have endeavoured to expreſs my ſelf as plainly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106337:32"/>as I could, and I deſire the Reader to look o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe Lines again, till he fully takes my meaning.</p>
                     <p>Now, Sir, if this Obſervation of mine ſhould hold as to all or but the major part of thoſe Quotations, it would do me conſiderable ſervice, and that upon more accounts than one.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It abſolutely confounds your <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, ſince in ſeveral of even <hi>theſe</hi> Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from <hi>Suidas,</hi> not (as I preſume) to be found in your MS. we find the Dr. advanced far beyond <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p n="2">2. It effectually clears the Dr. from having ſtoln <hi>from</hi> your MS. thoſe Quotations which are in your MS. For if he could of his own <hi>Sagacity</hi> fetch out of <hi>Suidas</hi> ſuch <hi>Fragments</hi> of <hi>Callimachus</hi> as had not the name of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor joyn'd with them, he cannot be ſuppoſed to have overlook'd thoſe where the very word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> ſtaring him in the face, could not but have put him in mind of his <hi>Common-place</hi> Book.<note place="margin">Supr. p. <hi>11.</hi>
                        </note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. We have here yet another inſtance of what I have ſo very often obſerv'd in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings againſt Dr. <hi>Bentley;</hi> That there is ſcarce any one ſingle Article any where advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him by way of Accuſation or Reproach; which, when throughly ſifted, doth not turn to his Acquitment and greater <hi>Approbation.</hi> As in the preſent caſe, what a plain proof is here of his extraordinary Readineſs at theſe ſorts of Studies,<note place="margin">Supr. p. <hi>12.</hi>
                        </note> and with how juſt an aſſurance he might make that <hi>Boaſt</hi> (for ſo, to be ſure, you'll call

Thus while you prefer againſt the Dr. an Accuſation of <hi>Plagiariſm,</hi> you do but the more fully prove to any one that will be at the pains of examining into the matter, how rich he is in his own Stores, and how little a loſer by being placed in any compariſon.</p>
                     <p>Ceaſe therefore, let me beſeech you, this your <hi>Critical War,</hi> or rather go on ſtill writing till you ſhall have made him, as generally <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved</hi> and <hi>admired</hi> at <hi>home</hi> as he is <hi>abroad.</hi>

                           <pb n="53" facs="tcp:106337:36"/>having taken (as moſt certainly he did) that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of fetching in his firſt Materials from the <hi>Indexes</hi> of Books, where thoſe <hi>Indexes</hi> were tolerably perfect: the Dr's <hi>Coincidencies</hi> with Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> muſt be proportionably frequent; and, as to thoſe particular Authors, far <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>number</hi> his <hi>Additions</hi> to it.</p>

And if the Experiment anſwers my expectation my inferences are plain. 1. That Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> did <hi>indeed</hi> take this method of fetching in his Fragments from the <hi>Indexes</hi> of Books. 2. Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> read over the Books themſelves, and was above both the <hi>Index</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s MS. Here are in all, Quotations out of <hi>Stephanus Byzant. forty;</hi> of which <hi>Eleven index'd,</hi> ſc. <hi>ten</hi> in the <hi>Index</hi> to <hi>Stephanus;</hi> and the other in <hi>Gruter</hi>'s Index: all theſe — <hi>in</hi> Mr. <hi>Stanley.</hi> — Not index'd <hi>twenty nine, — in</hi> Dr. <hi>Bentley. — Not,</hi> I ſuppoſe, in Mr. <hi>Stanley.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And if this Conjecture of mine ſhould hold, I think 'tis pretty much to the purpoſe. But where the <hi>Indexes</hi> are compleatly drawn, the like experiment cannot be made. In ſuch caſes a great part of the Dr's Quotations muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity have been anticipated by Mr. <hi>Stanley.</hi> Nor need I, I think, ſay more to ſhew the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of this Caution, not to judge of the Dr. by the <hi>great variety</hi> of his <hi>Coincidencies</hi> with Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> as to his Quotations out of ſuch Authors, where the Fragments of <hi>Callimachus</hi> are marked out in the <hi>Indexes.</hi> Nor,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Secondly, is he to judge of the Dr. by the <hi>great variety</hi> of his <hi>Coincidencies</hi> with Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> as to his Quotations from ſome few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106337:38"/>Authors, who may have no ſuch <hi>Indexes</hi> made to them. For with ſome particular Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> may have taken the ſame courſe as he hath with <hi>Suidas,</hi> and if ſo, the ſame effects of it will appear in his MS. As for example, I find the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> upon <hi>Nicander</hi> once produced by Dr. <hi>Bentley, n.</hi> 60. and that the ſame Fragment is in Mr. <hi>Stanley.</hi> Nor within the line of compariſon do I find any thing more of that <hi>Scholiaſt.</hi> But from after <hi>n.</hi> 103. I find the Dr. producing out of him ſeveral Fragments, as <hi>n.</hi> 139, 140, 201, 228, 253, 267, 268, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> had after his having began his Collection read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this <hi>Scholiaſt,</hi> thoſe Numbers of the Dr's muſt alſo be <hi>in</hi> Mr. <hi>Stanley.</hi> The like may be conjectured of the Fragments from <hi>Ammonius,</hi>

                        <p>Theſe two <hi>Cautions</hi> preceding will juſtifie the Reaſon of the two following, as that,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. He is not to diſcount from the Dr. every <hi>Number,</hi> the Fragment of which he may find in Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s MS.

For where a Fragment is preſerv'd but in one Author, and in him correct, there the Dr's Collection and Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s muſt fall in with the ſame Words and Syllables: for let two men tranſcribe the ſame Quotation from the ſame Author, I cannot ſee why it ſhould be to any one,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>P.</hi> 76.</note> as it ſeems to have been to our <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,</hi> a matter of Admiration, that they ſhould hit upon, not only the <hi>ſame ſenſe, but the ſame words.</hi> The reaſon of this <hi>Caution</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I hope, the Reader is ſatisfied in; that he ought not to diſcount from the Dr. every <hi>Number,</hi> the whole and only paſſage under which, without the leaſt Syllable of variation, he will find in Mr. <hi>Stanley.</hi> Much leſs is he, in the</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Fourth place, To <hi>abjudge</hi> from the Dr. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Number,</hi> of which only the leading Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in Mr. <hi>Stanley;</hi> and ſo, which is the <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s method, for the ſake of half a line in Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s MS. to caſhier, it may be, a whole Page, or two, or more, in the Dr. <hi>vid. ſupr. p.</hi> 33. But here alſo he is to remember and apply the diſtinction before made upon the <hi>Quotations</hi> out of <hi>Suidas,</hi> and to take into the account the many <hi>Additions</hi> of the Dr's <hi>own</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king under every <hi>Number,</hi> and to conſider not only the <hi>Quantity</hi> of his Additions, but the <hi>Quality</hi> of them alſo. And particularly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106337:40"/>or no thoſe <hi>Additions</hi> are not ſuch as would have ſupported the <hi>Number</hi> it ſelf, though the Fragment, ſuppoſed to have been taken from Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> had not been there. As for inſtance, the <hi>Fragment, n.</hi> 179. is <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. This Fragment the Collator will undoubtedly find in Mr. <hi>Stanley:</hi> for 'tis (with only a little difference in ſpelling the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>) in both the <hi>Etymologicon</hi> and <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> and <hi>index'd</hi> in both theſe Authors. And yet the Dr. did not ſteal it from Mr. <hi>Stanley;</hi> for 'tis in both <hi>Vulcanius</hi> and <hi>Dacier</hi>'s printed Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, <hi>vid. ſupr. p.</hi> 20. <hi>Exc.</hi> 3. But in the Dr's Collection this ſame Fragment is produc'd from a <hi>new Authority,</hi> ſc. <hi>Artemidorus</hi> his <hi>Onei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocriticks:</hi> which <hi>new Authority</hi> is not in any of the other Collections. <hi>Qu.</hi> Is it in Mr. <hi>Stanley?</hi> If not: then this <hi>Fragment</hi> would have been in the Dr's Collection, though it had not been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Etymologicon,</hi> or <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> or <hi>Vulca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> or <hi>Dacier,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Stanley:</hi> Therefore this <hi>Number</hi> muſt not be caſhier'd. Changing the name of <hi>Artemidori Oneirocritica</hi> into <hi>Euſebius Praep. Evang.</hi> The caſe is exactly the ſame with the Fragments from <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, n.</hi> 87, 133. Now in ſuch caſes, though the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf be in Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> yet the <hi>new Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities</hi> from whence it is produced makes it the Dr's <hi>own,</hi> and ſecures to him even the <hi>Tale</hi> of his <hi>Numbers.</hi> Inſtances of this kind I could produce by Scores, where the Fragment it ſelf would have been in the Dr's Collection, though it had not been in any of the others. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo many Fragments would have been in the Dr's Collection, though they ſhould have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Obſervation of all that went before
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106337:40"/>him; 'tis not very likely that many of thoſe Fragments collected by them would have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Dr.</p>
                        <p>And thus much by way of <hi>Caution</hi> to the <hi>Collator</hi> of the MS. the juſtneſs and reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which I ſubmit to the judgment of the Impartial, nay, or even the moſt partial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Many more of the like nature and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy may he collect for himſelf from the whole Tenour of my Diſcourſe foregoing; but I have ſatisfied my ſelf in particularizing upon theſe few. Furniſhed therefore with theſe <hi>Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> let him go to the <hi>Half Moon,</hi> collate the MS. and ſpeak as he finds. And ſo <hi>good an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion have I of my own Performance,</hi> as to hope, that he will find, that I have done even more than my work, and anſwer'd as well what <hi>I have not ſeen, as what I have.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>Suidas</hi> hath carried me on (ſuch is the <hi>Chain</hi> of Thought) a wide circumference, and made me lanch out into unknown Seas. But our <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s Appeal to the MS. was a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation I found my ſelf unable to withſtand: and whether my Diſcoveries will prove Land or Clouds will ſoon be known; unleſs upon ſome ſudden occaſion or other the MS. ſhould chance to the called in.</p>
                        <p>I made a kind of promiſe of managing three or four <hi>Decads</hi> of our Vindicator's <hi>

Such is the Book I am anſwering. And ſince I am fallen upon ſo dry a Subject, I were willing to give

                  <p>The Dr.'s <hi>ſome</hi> Additions in this part of his Collecion, <hi>ſc</hi> from. <hi>n.</hi> 57. <hi>p.</hi> 321. to <hi>n.</hi> 103. <hi>p.</hi> 355. are ſo numerous, and ſo very unpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to thoſe few things in Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s MS. that there's no ſtating <hi>Accounts</hi> between them. And yet as I have (after our Vindicator's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod) drawn up the <hi>Numbers,</hi> n. 57, 58, 59, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they make an handſome ſhew againſt him. But as for that, let the Reader ſee what hath been ſaid before <hi>p.</hi> 33. and let the Collator turn to <hi>n.</hi> 66, and conſult Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s MS. <hi>p.</hi> 35. There he will find a little <hi>Scrap</hi> of a <hi>Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from out of <hi>Suidas.</hi> But the putting this <hi>Fragment</hi> into its proper <hi>meaſures,</hi> the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the <hi>Etymologicon,</hi> the reducing it to its proper place, the confirming it from <hi>Tzetzes,</hi> and from that place in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> from whence <hi>Tzetzes</hi> produces it; this is all the Dr's own. From all which it appears that this Fragment would have been in Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> though it had ſcaped all the other Collectors, <hi>ut ſupr.</hi> p. 60. Then Follows in the Dr. about a Page and half of Quotations, Corrections, and Explications, of which but one Line, and that from the <hi>Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologicon,</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:106337:46"/>index'd, <hi>in</hi> Mr. <hi>Stanley;</hi> at leaſt but that one line in this place. For I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that all the four Veries of this Fragment, <hi>n.</hi> 67. as from <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> may be in Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> but miſplac'd, <hi>ſc.</hi> among the <hi>Epigrams.</hi> Then three Quotations in Mr. <hi>Stanley, ſc.</hi> 68. out of <hi>Suidas,</hi> printed with all the Editions of <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> 69. <hi>Athenaeus, index'd,</hi> n. 71. a Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of <hi>Suidas,</hi> corrected indeed by Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> but crudely, and in ſuch a manner as ſufficiently ſhews how haſtily and <hi>incuriouſly</hi> he drew up this <hi>imperfect Draught.</hi> For theſe three Quotations <hi>in</hi> Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> about as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pages in Dr. <hi>Benthley.

He will find the Dr's <hi>ſome</hi> Additions bearing much the ſame proportion as before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeveral <hi>Decads.</hi> After <hi>n.</hi> 96. p. 344. to <hi>n.</hi> 103. p. 355. The Dr's <hi>ſome</hi> Additions do ſo drown the <hi>ſome</hi> Quotations in Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s MS. that one muſt look very hard to get now and then a ſight of one of them, ſaving ſome of the large Capitals, that is, the Titles of ſome of <hi>Callimachus</hi> his Works from <hi>Suidas</hi> and <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, in</hi> Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> and <hi>in Vulcanius,</hi> and <hi>in Dacier,</hi> and very few of them not <hi>in</hi> every Edition of <hi>Callimachus,</hi> that hath yet come from the Preſs, and yet, ſaith our <hi>Vindicator,</hi> tranſcribed <hi>from</hi> Mr. <hi>Stanley;</hi> Yes, tranſcribed from Mr. <hi>Stanley, in</hi> whom had
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106337:46"/>not the Doctor met them, in vain had they been in every printed <hi>Callimachus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I gone through all thoſe Proofs of our <hi>Vindicator,</hi> which lie in the direct line, and examin'd them one by one. <hi>I have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them all with great</hi> Fairneſs, <hi>I am ſure, and,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>B. p.</hi> 181.</note> 
                     <hi>I fear, with more exactneſs than they will be thought to deſerve.</hi> And now, without mincing the matter, I dare boldly pronounce my ſelf Victor in this Cauſe. No Reader, <hi>I am ſure,</hi> that underſtands any thing of the Subject we are upon, can think any <hi>one</hi> of all theſe <hi>Proofs</hi> againſt the Dr. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndeniable.</hi> And as for him that underſtands nothing of it; let him hold his peace, and not run on (as has been of late the humour of the <hi>Town</hi>) clamouring upon Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> for he knows not what. Only becauſe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath the Talent of telling a Story very <hi>prettily,</hi> therefore Dr. <hi>B.</hi> is a <hi>Dunce,</hi> a <hi>Clown,</hi> a <hi>Pedant,</hi> and all the reſt of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Book.</p>
                  <p>But one demonſtrative Argument you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dr. not as yet ſo much as once touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon by me: and that is the <hi>method</hi> in which his Collection is digeſted. The Dr's Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Quotations are a great part of them printed in the very ſelf ſame <hi>order</hi> and <hi>method</hi> in which they ſtand in Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s MS. And though two men might light upon the ſame Quotations, yet how ſhould they hit upon it to ſet them down in the ſame order, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving written the one after the other? This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to a man that knows nothing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bears the appearance of an Argument, and you ſeem to lay a great ſtreſs upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſhall prove,</hi> ſay you, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Stanley<hi>'s Locks were pick'd, and his Trunks rifled;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 32.</note> 
                     <hi>and that</hi> (among other things) <hi>Dr.</hi> Bentley<hi>'s me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106337:47"/>in Marſhalling his Fragments, was taken from that very Learned Gentleman.</hi> And in the next Page, <hi>But it's remarkable, that to manage the affair dextrouſly, Dr</hi> Bentley <hi>has in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (it may be believ'd wilfully, and to conceal the Fraud) inverted the order of the MS.</hi> And much to the ſame purpoſe, but ſomewhat more <hi>ſatyrically,</hi> do you deliver your ſelf, p. 78.</p>
                  <p>Now what is this <hi>Method?</hi> what deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance was there in it, that Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> could not have reach'd it himſelf? This <hi>Method</hi> is purely <hi>Alphabetical;</hi> that is, the ſeveral <hi>Titles</hi> of the loſt pieces of <hi>Callimachus</hi> are ſet down in the order of the <hi>Alphabet;</hi> as, Α. <gap reason="foreign">

But there being many Fragments bearing no <hi>Title,</hi> nor carrying in them any plain Indication to what Tracts of that Author they belonged, theſe are thrown together promiſcuouſly at the end of the other, under the common Character of <hi>Fragmenta incerti loci.</hi> This is that method which our Vindicator makes ſo ſtrong an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Dr. than which, a more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious thought could not have enter'd into any mans head, than to put things which have no dependance one upon the other into the order of the <hi>Alphabet.</hi> In this <hi>Alphabetical</hi> order, long before Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> drew up his <hi>imperfect Draught,</hi> were collected and digeſted the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Ariſtophanes, Aeſchylus, Sophocles, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides, Theophraſtus, Varro, Nigidius Figulus, Lucilius,</hi> and ſeveral others. So that the Dr. <hi>how natural ſoever it may be to him to tranſgreſs the Rules of Method,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 78.</note> 
                     <hi>when he is ſolely under his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106337:47"/>own Government;</hi> yet he had here Precedents enough before him beſides Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s MS. to have given him this lucky hint. And this I think may ſuffice for that mighty Argument of yours, the <hi>regular Digeſtion</hi> of his Fragments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But it's very remarkable, that to manage the affair dextrouſly, Dr.</hi> Bentley <hi>has in ſome places (it may be believ'd wilfully, and to conceal the Fraud) inverted the order of the MS. But this,</hi> You ſay, <hi>will be remember'd in due time and place.</hi>

                  <p>But he hath in <hi>ſome places inverted</hi> the order of the MS.</p>

                  <p>I have now performed all that, as far as you are concerned in it, my Title page promiſes. For upon the former part of your Book I had once deſigned a ſeparate conſideration. But I am weary of my work, and, I fanſie, both <hi>your ſelf</hi> and the Reader think it high time for me to have done with you. Yet ſince it might look ſomewhat ſuſpiciouſly to take no manner of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, I ſhall, with all the Brevity imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, beſtow upon it a curſory Reflection or two.</p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:106337:76"/>
                  <p>That former part of your Book contains in it a moſt grievous Accuſation. Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Inhumanity</hi> to thoſe <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> who have written before him. Upon which I cannot but in the firſt place obſerve to the Reader; that had one deſigned to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> upon the Dr. one could not have pitch'd upon a more proper Subject for it, than what this man makes choice of for matter of Reproach againſt him: All this <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Inhumanity</hi> of the Dr. to thoſe Authors who have written before him terminating in this point; That Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> hath obſerved ſome miſtakes that have drop'd from the Pens of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Great Men, who have written before him, and corrected them: a ſervice for which he hath received the publick acknowledgment of perſons altogether as conſiderable in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Learning, as any of the Retainers to the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> Club. But if the Dr. doth (as indeed he pretty often doth) diſagree from the opinions of thoſe Great Men, who have written before him, it is, though ſometimes with the aſſurance of a man that knows what he is ſpeaking of, yet always, with a due reſpect and deference to the worth of the perſons from whom he Diſſents. But let us proceed to particulars.</p>

                  <p>V.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> The ſame moſt Learned <hi>Voſſius</hi> he ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arraigns in another place of committing a great miſtake without <hi>Conſideration</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>W. You <hi>miſconſtrue</hi> the Dr. again, and turn his words to a ſenſe directly contrary to what they intend, Dr. <hi>B. ep. p.</hi> 83. <hi>non certo judicio, ſed inconſideratè, preterque morem egiſſe videtur.</hi> The ſenſe of the Dr's words is plainly this, That though <hi>Voſſius</hi> had written the Name <hi>Malela</hi> without an <hi>s,</hi> yet 'twas <hi>not</hi> his <hi>certum judicium, not</hi> his <hi>own</hi> Judgment, or his own <hi>ſtanding</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it ought always to be ſo written; for <hi>that</hi> his own practice contradicted: but he wrote it ſo, <hi>inconſideratè, praeterque morem, inaccurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> incuriouſly, or (if you will have it ſo) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately; <hi>praeterque morem,</hi> and contrary to his uſual practice. For the whole ſtreſs of the Dr's argument is, that 'twas not <hi>Voſſius</hi>'s his ſtanding opinion, that the name <hi>Malela</hi> ought to be written without an <hi>s.</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106337:77"/>that his writing it ſo, could not be through <hi>ignorance,</hi> or miſtake, or for <hi>want of judgment;</hi> but purely either through inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, or rather with a contented unexactneſs in compliance with ſome other Authors who had uſued that way of writing it. So that you here charge the Dr. with charging <hi>Voſſius</hi> with <hi>want</hi> of <hi>judgment,</hi> when the Dr. is arguing <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi> the contrary, and <hi>diſcharging</hi> him from that ſuſpicion.

                  <p>One word to the <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> and I have done. That that <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> is not of your own writing, I have before told you, I am certain.

As for my part, I have a clear different notion of it, and think that Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> could not have done the Dr. a greater piece of ſervice than he hath by writing this <hi>Appendix,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath ſo fairly driven the matter to an head, and let ſuch light into the cauſe, that it can be no longer a Diſpute, where the Quarrel began, and what was that unſufferable affront which rendred the Dr. an Enemy unfit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Quarter.

               <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 102. <hi>The Dr. called in every now and then at my Shop, for we were then in</hi> good term; <hi>together, and he was pleaſed to conſult me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times about Matters in my way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon let the Collator look Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> full in the face, and ask him a civil Queſtion or two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query.</hi> And were not thoſe <hi>diſobliging</hi> Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions relating to Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> and the <hi>work</hi> he was upon, utter'd by Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> during the time that the Dr. and your ſelf, Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> were very good <hi>Friends</hi> together, and while the Dr. was ſo familiar and confiding with you, as to <hi>conſult</hi> you ſometimes about Matters in your way? And particularly was it not within this Period of time that the Dr. <hi>threw out</hi> that <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitally</hi> great <hi>&amp; caetera</hi> Reflection which you ſpeak of, <hi>pag.</hi> 131? And is it not enough to make a man afraid, Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> of calling in at the Sign of the <hi>Half-Moon?</hi> and ought not a man to have a care how he moves his Lips there? leaſt his words ſhould be catch'd up as they drop from his Mouth, and afterwards, it may be, <hi>affidavited</hi> againſt him, put into print, and made part of a Lampoon upon him. Theſe are dangerous Conſiderations, Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and a ſufficient caution to a man, how he enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to too near a familiarity with the Bookſeller at the <hi>Half-Moon.</hi> For though you and I may ſtand at preſent in good terms with each other, yet who knows, who and who may be together a Twelvemonth hence?</p>

               <hi>Coll.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> he that takes upon him to ſpeak as a <hi>ſworn Witneſs</hi> ought to declare the <hi>whole</hi> Truth, as well as nothing <hi>but</hi> the Truth.

            <p>Mr <hi>Bennet</hi>'s <hi>firſt</hi> account in Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Book, <hi>p.</hi> 6. <hi>I was employ'd by the Honourable Mr.</hi> Boyle <hi>(and by him only) to borrow the MS. of</hi> Phalaris <hi>from Dr.</hi> Bentley. <hi>After about</hi> nine Months. <hi>ſollicitation it was delivered into my Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coll.</hi> Was Dr. <hi>Bentley Library-Keeper,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> during this <hi>nine Months</hi> time that you were <hi>ſolliciting</hi> for the MS?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I crave your pardon for <hi>that,</hi> Sir: you don't find me ſaying any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coll.</hi> Ay, but Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> to deal plainly with you, here were you guilty of a very <hi>frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent Concealment.</hi> No <hi>honeſt man,</hi> or one that had been minded to do Juſtice, would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd himſelf to looſely when he was ſpeaking as upon <hi>Oath.</hi> This was a very groſs <hi>Omiſſion,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and 'tis to be ſeared, a <hi>wilfull</hi> one. The Dr's being <hi>Library-Keeper,</hi> or not <hi>Library-Keeper</hi> during that <hi>nine Months</hi> time, is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial a circumtance, that it gives a clear diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent caſt to the whole <hi>matter of fact,</hi> and makes all Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Book run upon a very <hi>foul</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake: and 'tis ſcarce to be imagined, that the <hi>Omiſſion</hi> of a circumſtance upon which ſo much depended, and which <hi>expreſs'd</hi> would have ſpoil'd all Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Book, was purely an <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> This buſineſs of the <hi>nine Months</hi> Sollicitation is fairly ſtated in my <hi>Appendix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coll.</hi> Ay, Mr. <hi>Bennet.</hi> But that was not till Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> had firſt <hi>ſtated</hi> it for you, and ſtated it upon ſuch <hi>Authorities</hi> there was no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting. Otherwiſe the <hi>Town</hi> might ſtill have
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106337:84"/>been, by the help of your <hi>faithfull relation,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> upon it, no leſs than <hi>eight</hi> Months in <hi>nine</hi> out in their reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But let's ſee how Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> manages your <hi>firſt</hi> account, and what Explication he gives of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>B. p</hi> 2. <hi>About four or five years ago, the worthy Dean of</hi> Chriſt-Church, <hi>Dr.</hi> Aldrich, <hi>deſired me to undertake an Edition of</hi> Phalaris. <hi>In order to it a Manuſcript in the</hi> King's Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>was to be conſulted. I ſent to Mr.</hi> Bennet, <hi>my Bookſeller in</hi> London <hi>to get the Manuſcript, and deſired him to apply himſelf to Dr.</hi> Bentley <hi>in</hi> my name <hi>for the uſe of it, not doubting in the leaſt a ready compliance with ſuch a Requeſt from one of his</hi> Station <hi>and Order. After an expectation of</hi> many Months, <hi>Mr.</hi> Bennet <hi>ſends me at laſt a Collation of part of the MS. with this account, that he had with a</hi> great difficulty, <hi>and after long delays, got the MS. into his hand.</hi> And again, <hi>p.</hi> 19. <hi>The Reader is deſired to take notice, that there was about</hi> nine Months Sollicitation <hi>uſed to procure it; a longer time than — the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Inauguration to his</hi> Library-Keeper's <hi>place could require.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sparkling Lines! in which, if there be any <hi>deſign</hi> beyond <hi>Phraſe,</hi> it muſt be this, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to the Reader, that the Dr. was, for at leaſt, a <hi>great part</hi> of that <hi>nine Months</hi> time <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary-Keeper,</hi> and had the MS. in his <hi>cuſtody.</hi> Or if we muſt not look for <hi>meaning</hi> here, where he is only pouring out <hi>words,</hi> yet in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer paſſage he ſeems to ſpeak plain Senſe, and in the more <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>hiſtorical</hi> Stile.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> Therefore; what <hi>Station</hi> can Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> there intend? muſt it not be that of <hi>Library-Keeper</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:106337:84"/>to his <hi>Majeſty?</hi> Nay, is not this made the aggravating circumſtance of the whole <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact,</hi> that one in the Dr's <hi>Station</hi> ſhould refuſe ſo <hi>common a favour,</hi>

So I am ſure the Town took it, that the whole ground of the Quarrel between Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> and Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> lay in the Dr's refuſing to a perſon of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Quality the uſe of a Book out of the <hi>Library</hi> of which he was <hi>Keeper,</hi> and conſequently the proper perſon to whom ſuch an Application was to be made. This <hi>falſe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the <hi>matter of fact</hi> was neceſſary in order to the uſe Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> had to make of it, which was to juſtifie the peculiar Liberties it was reſolved that <hi>young Gentleman</hi> ſhould take with one of his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Servants.

The <hi>diſobliging delays,</hi> and <hi>great difficulties</hi> Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> put them to in procuring the MS. and when at laſt they
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106337:85"/>had it, the little time he let it lie in their hands. All which being a <hi>partial, diſguiſed,</hi> and <hi>diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> relation of the <hi>matter of fact,</hi> and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived on purpoſe to miſlead the Reader, he that ſhall publickly atteſt it, by giving it under his hand in print, and make an offer of affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it upon <hi>Oath</hi> for a <hi>faithfull</hi> relation,<note place="margin">Append. p. <hi>93.</hi>
               </note> deſerves as <hi>courſe</hi> a <hi>Complement</hi> as the Dr. gave him.</p>
            <p>But let us proceed to Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s <hi>ſecond</hi> account, and ſee how he qualifies the matter there.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Appendix, <hi>p.</hi> 99. <hi>There was not a ſingle word in my relation, that doth in the leaſt imply me to have thought the Dr.</hi> Library-Keeper <hi>the whole time I ask'd him for the MS. I only apply'd to him as a</hi> Friend, <hi>very conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in theſe things, who lived not far from the</hi> Royal Library, <hi>had an</hi> intereſt <hi>there, and could have</hi> procured <hi>the MS. for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Idem, p. 103. <hi>I never went to Dr.</hi> Bentley <hi>upon the Errant of borrowing the MS. I only ſpoke to him about it ſometimes as he ſtopt at my Shop, or paſs'd by it. Though I ask'd him ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> (twenty <hi>times at leaſt</hi>) <hi>that I might well ſay</hi> I ſollicited <hi>for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Idem, p. 109. <hi>I admit ſo far of the Dr's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that the MS. was delivered, uſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned within a</hi> Month <hi>(or rather five weeks) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was in his Cuſtody. But I apply'd to him ſeven or eight Months</hi> before <hi>he was</hi> Library-Keeper.</p>
            <p>Idem, p. 110. <hi>He had</hi> intereſt <hi>enough to have</hi> procured <hi>it me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Idem. p. 111. <hi>I do not ſay that the Dr. could have LENT me the Book much ſooner than he did. But that he could have GOT the Book to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

            <p>Upon this <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> account of Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s, the <hi>Collator</hi> might teize him with a world of troubleſome queſtions. As <hi>Coll.</hi> Had you orders, Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the MS. for him <hi>nine Months</hi> before you got it into your hands? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> At leaſt <hi>Coll.</hi> And he directed you to Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> for it, and to make uſe of his <hi>name</hi> to the Dr. for it? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Yes. <hi>Coll. Nine Months</hi> before you obtain'd it? Mr. <hi>B. Yes. Coll.</hi> This was neceſſary to put a fair gloſs upon the matter, but it looks ſomewhat ſuſpicious. The Dr. was not <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Keeper nine Months</hi> before you had it? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> No. <hi>Coll.</hi> Or in proſpect of being <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Keeper?</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> That he might be For there was a <hi>Rumour of his ſtanding fair for that Office ſome conſiderable time before he actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon it. Coll.</hi> What <hi>nine Months</hi> before? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Perhaps. <hi>Coll</hi> Scarce ſo, Mr. <hi>Bennet.</hi> For I am apt to believe, that for ſome part of thoſe <hi>nine Months,</hi> Mr. <hi>Juſtel,</hi> the Dr's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor in that Office, might be living. And Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> being a perfect Stranger to the Dr. it doth not look very probable, that he ſhould ſend you to Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> in his <hi>name,</hi> for a MS. out of the <hi>Royal Library,</hi> when the Dr. neither was <hi>Library-Keeper,</hi> nor at that time ſo much as in proſpect of being ſo. I am rather inclined to believe, that upon Recollection you would find, that Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> for ſome of the former of thoſe <hi>nine Months,</hi> only gave you orders in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to procure him the MS. and being ſo long delay'd, in caſting up the accounts draws the whole into one Summ, and, to avoid Fractions,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106337:86"/>throws it all upon the Dr. Recollect your Thoughts, Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and judge of the <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of the thing. But again, Mr. <hi>Bennet.</hi> Did Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> ever write any thing himſelf to Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> about the MS? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Not that I know of. <hi>Coll</hi> Why then Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> was not affronted by the Dr. to near that degree he would make the world believe. How can he make ſuch a ſtir about being refuſed a favour which he never condeſcended to ask? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> But he employ'd me to ask it for him: and that's the ſame thing. <hi>Coll.</hi> No, Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the ſame thing. But to let that paſs. How long was the Dr. <hi>actually Library-Keeper</hi> and in <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Key,</hi> before you had the MS? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Not long <hi>actually Library-Keeper. Coll.</hi> But how long? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> A Fortnight, or three Weeks, it may be, or thereabouts. <hi>Coll.</hi> What a fall is here, Mr. <hi>Bennet?</hi> This <hi>nine Months</hi> delay, I find, is ſunk into a <hi>Fortnight</hi> or <hi>three Weeks:</hi> Is this your <hi>faithfull Relation?</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> But he <hi>liv'd</hi> at that end o'th' <hi>Town,</hi> and he had <hi>intereſt</hi> enough there to have <hi>procured</hi> it for me, if he had been ſo minded. <hi>Coll.</hi> But ſuppoſe the Dr. did not think himſelf obliged, Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> to runs on your Errands? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> My Errands? 'twas Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Errands. <hi>Coll.</hi> My. <hi>Boyle</hi> never wrote a word to him about it. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> But when I ſpake to him of it, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd that <hi>he would help me to it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 100, 111.</note> and that I <hi>ſincerely affirm. Coll.</hi> That is, he would <hi>help you to it,</hi> when it ſhould come to be in his own <hi>power</hi> to help you to it. And ſo he did. For <hi>no ſooner</hi> was he <hi>actually</hi> poſſeſt of his place, than that he delivered it to you. Did he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to run about from one to another to <hi>BOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROW</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:106337:86"/>it for you? But how long was it after he was <hi>actually</hi> in poſſeſſion of his Office e'er you had the MS? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> About a Fortnight or three Weeks, I tell you; or it may be, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more. <hi>Coll.</hi> But how long do ye think at moſt? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Why, it may be, <hi>a Month.</hi> See what I have written, <hi>p.</hi> 105, 106. <hi>Coll.</hi> I have read thoſe pages you refer to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd them. There's nothing there but wild and groundleſs <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> all of your own making. And as for every word you have ſaid there, I am as much at liberty to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrary to what <hi>you</hi> ſuppoſe. And how then would you help your ſelf? And therefore paſſing over that for a <hi>Nothing,</hi> let me ask you, How many times were you with the Dr. about it <hi>after</hi> he was <hi>Library-Keeper?</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> With him about it? I was never with him about i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> at all, either before or after. I only ſpake to him of it, as I met him now and then by chance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 103.</note> There <hi>was no need of my taking journeys to him, 'twas but juſt</hi> giving him a word or two, now and then, <hi>as he ſtept into my Shop or paſs'd by it. There was nothing at all of trouble in it. Coll.</hi> So us in your <hi>ſecond</hi> account indeed, but in your <hi>firſt</hi> account which you ſent to Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> 'twas not without <hi>great difficulty,</hi> that <hi>after long delays,</hi> at laſt you got it into your hands. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Why, I ask'd him for't ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>twenty</hi> times at leaſt. <hi>Coll.</hi> But without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtepping <hi>twenty</hi> Inches out of your way for it. A great <hi>difficulty!</hi> And yet <hi>both</hi> your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts are true to a <hi>Tittle.</hi> Well! but <hi>after</hi> he was <hi>Library-Keeper</hi> you <hi>ſoon</hi> had it. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> But not what he Dr. ſaith, <hi>as ſoon as</hi> he was <hi>Library-Keeper.</hi> There I think I have

               <hi>caught</hi> the Dr. But ſee the whole matter in my <hi>Appendix</hi> it ſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 104, 105. <hi>Coll.</hi> But to ſhorten the matter, tell it your ſelf by word of Mouth. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Why then I ſay I have caught the Dr. in a <hi>falſhood,</hi> Sir, and can prove it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him out of his own Mouth. <hi>Coll.</hi> That's a <hi>Complement</hi> very familiar with you. But how? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Why, he ſaith, that <hi>as ſoon as it was in his power</hi> he gave it me. But it was not till <hi>three Weeks</hi> after, or, it may be, more. And is that <hi>as ſoon as? Coll.</hi> Why no truly. In ſtrictneſs of Speech, he ſhould <hi>as ſoon as ever</hi> he had received the Key, <hi>immediately, forth-with,</hi> the <hi>very ſame Minute</hi> have run into the Library, Snatch'd up the <hi>MS.</hi> clapt it in his Pocket, and without ſtaying ſo much as to comb his Periwig, have poſted away with it to the <hi>Half-Moon.</hi> And then he might have ſaid <hi>as ſoon as.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Do you <hi>banter</hi> me? It may coſt you dear. I have them that can <hi>banter</hi> with you for your ears, in <hi>Verſe</hi> and <hi>Proſe. Coll.</hi> But how long was it <hi>after</hi> he had it in his <hi>power</hi> e'er you receiv'd it? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Why <hi>three Weeks,</hi> I tell you, or, it may be, more. And is that, <hi>as ſoon as? Coll.</hi> But how did you come by it at laſt? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Why I met him in the Street, I renew'd my Requeſt to him about the MS. He told me I ſhould have it, bad me ſend my Prentice to him, I ſent him, and he delivered it. <hi>Coll.</hi> And ſo you had it? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> And ſo I had it. But not <hi>as ſoon as</hi>—There the Dr's <hi>Memory failed him. Coll.</hi> But had you <hi>ſeen</hi> the Dr. <hi>after</hi> he was <hi>Library-Keeper</hi> any time <hi>before</hi> this time that you ask'd him for the MS and had it? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I had ask'd him for it <hi>twenty</hi> times before. <hi>Coll.</hi> What, <hi>after</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:106337:87"/>he was <hi>Library-Keeper?</hi> Had you ſo much as <hi>once</hi> ſeen him, or ſpake to him, or ſent to him about it, <hi>after</hi> he was <hi>Library-Keeper, before</hi> this time that you ask'd for it, and had it? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Not <hi>after</hi> he was <hi>Library Keeper,</hi> but I know not how many times <hi>before. Coll.</hi> That is <hi>before</hi> it was in his <hi>power</hi> to lend it you. But <hi>after</hi> it was in his <hi>power</hi> you no <hi>ſooner</hi> ask'd than receiv'd. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> But he might have <hi>procured</hi> it for me <hi>before. Coll.</hi> And that's all you have to ſay for your ſelf. There's not a word of this <hi>procuring</hi> it for you in your <hi>firſt</hi> account. A poor come-off, Mr. <hi>Bennet.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> But how will you <hi>reconcile</hi> the Dr. with <hi>himſelf?</hi> In one place he ſaith, <hi>As</hi> ſoon <hi>as it was in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I went voluntarily and offer'd it him:</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place; Mr. <hi>Bennet meeting me again renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the former Requeſt, and I readily granted it;</hi> and in another place, that <hi>he order'd me to ſend my Prentice to his Lodgings for it.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106337:88"/>what you deſire the Reader to believe of your ſelf,<note place="margin">P. 120.</note> that he is not a man, <hi>who loves to tell Lies for no manner of purpoſe.</hi> For whether the Dr. (<hi>after</hi> his being actually <hi>Library-Keeper</hi>) <hi>firſt</hi> ſpake to you of the Manuſcript, or you <hi>firſt</hi> ſpake to the Dr. the caſe remains ſtill the ſame, that, <hi>after</hi> he was <hi>Library-Keeper,</hi> you <hi>no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> ask'd for it than you had it. But ſecondly, I ſee not that <hi>Inconſiſtency</hi> in the Dr's relation upon which you make ſuch a <hi>Flouriſh.</hi> For let me but ſuppoſe what I believe to be in <hi>fact</hi> true, that this meeting was the <hi>firſt</hi> Interview the Dr. and you had <hi>after</hi> his being poſſeſs'd of the <hi>Keys:</hi> then, Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> there is nothing more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral on both ſides, than either for you to have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed your Requeſt</hi> to the Dr. about the MS. or for the Dr. to have <hi>made the offer</hi> without your renewing it. So that the whole matter lies upon the chance of who ſhould ſpeak <hi>firſt.</hi> Let me feign a little <hi>Dialogiſm</hi> between your ſelf and the Dr. upon this occaſion. Meeting him therefore by chance in the Streets (as <hi>Fleetſtreet</hi> ſuppoſe) you make a ſtop, and thus accoſt him.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dr.</hi> Bentley. <hi>I could not</hi> lend <hi>it before I had it to lend.</hi> As ſoon <hi>as it is in my keeping, you ſee, 'tis ready for you. And pray let the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men know as much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs this is a <hi>feigned</hi> Dialogue; but, I think there is nothing ſtreined or unnatural in it, and, though I go upon pure <hi>dint of Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;</hi> yet I fanſie it comes as near to the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>fact</hi> as any thing you have written, Mr. <hi>Bennet.</hi> Upon ſuch an occaſion it is ſcarce poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but that both <hi>you</hi> ſhould ſpeak to the Dr. and the Dr. to <hi>you</hi> about a buſineſs which had been ſo long depending: and much after the manner I have repreſented it. And take it which way you will, whether the Dr. <hi>firſt</hi> ſpake to <hi>you,</hi> or <hi>you</hi> firſt ſpake to the Dr. the matter comes much to the ſame; and the Dr. might juſtly enough at one time ſay, that he <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily offer'd</hi> it to you; and at another time, that you <hi>renewed your Requeſt</hi> to him about it. For both of them may be literally true. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Yes, truly; if you'll put words into my Mouth for me, you may make what you pleaſe of me. <hi>Coll.</hi> Not worſe of you than you have made of your ſelf, Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> by printing <hi>ſuch</hi> an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix</hi> to <hi>ſuch</hi> a Book. Let a By-ſtander judge whether there be any thing unnatural in the matter, as I have repreſented it, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> But how can you bring him off as to th'other point. <hi>I went voluntarily to him,</hi> ſaith the Dr. <hi>and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd it him.</hi> And yet in another place, <hi>I bad him ſend his Prentice to me, and he ſhould have it.</hi>

What do <hi>theſe</hi> words, <hi>I went volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, and offer'd it to him,</hi> neceſſarily imply, that he put it up in his Pocket, and delivered it to you with his own hands? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I ſay, that he <hi>deſigned</hi> the Reader ſhould underſtand it ſo. <hi>Coll.</hi> But, <hi>I ſay,</hi> he <hi>deſigned</hi> no ſuch thing. For, pray Sir, what did he deſign in theſe words; <hi>He ſent his Prentice to the Library for it by my</hi> Appointment. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe words is plain enough. <hi>Coll.</hi> And theſe words, coming from the ſame mouth, make the meaning of the other words plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the poſſibility of a Miſ-conſtruction. I <hi>voluntarily went and offer'd it to him.</hi> That is, <hi>I voluntarily went and told him,</hi> that <hi>now</hi> the MS was in my keeping Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> might command the uſe of it, and, Mr. <hi>Bennet, if you'll ſend your Prentice to the Library for it,</hi> you ſhall have it. In all this, I defie any Mortal to find out any Inconſiſtency or Contradiction. Is there? Syllable here, that <hi>implies</hi> the Dr. to have <hi>brought</hi> it to the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> himſelf? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I <hi>ſay,</hi> the Dr. <hi>evidently deſigned them to imply ſo. Coll.</hi> I ſay, that's a <hi>Lye, Mr Bennet.</hi> Accept of ſome of your own <hi>Civilities.</hi> You and your Friends together have given the Dr. the <hi>Lye</hi> in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106337:89"/>Print, and printed <hi>Lyes</hi> upon the Dr. over and over.

            <p>Come, come, Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> after all your Shufflings, and <hi>double</hi> telling your Stories, this buſineſs of the <hi>nine Months</hi> Sollicitation, the <hi>great difficulty,</hi> the <hi>diſobliging</hi> Delays, the <hi>rude, uncivil, unmannerly</hi> Library-Keeper at St. <hi>James</hi>'s is foul play all over, and direct <hi>Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation.</hi> And all Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Book, and all the noiſe it hath made in the word, runs upon this <hi>foul</hi> account of yours.

The caſe is plain; the Dr. accommodated Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> with the uſe of the MS. <hi>as ſoon as</hi> 'twas in his <hi>power</hi> to lend it, and choſe rather to treſpaſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the duty of his place,<note place="margin">Vid <hi>Dr.</hi> B's Pref. p. <hi>23.</hi>
               </note> than to be guilty of any thing that might ſeem want of Reſpect to a perſon of that <hi>Honourable Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Story</hi> of the MS. is all in all in Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Book, and therefore I could not balk the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of conſidering it ſomewhat particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, though I have paſs'd by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s own words afford
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106337:90"/>againſt himſelf; and particularly as to his careleſs management of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Affairs, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt charging the Conſequences of his own Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence upon Dr. <hi>Bentley.</hi> The ſumm of the whole is this; that the Dr. <hi>lent</hi> them the SM. <hi>as ſoon as</hi> it was in his <hi>power</hi> to <hi>lend</hi> it; or if they will not admit of that, <hi>as ſoon as;</hi> then, that the only neglect of the Dr. was, that he did not, <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>literally</hi> ſpeaking, <hi>as ſoon as</hi> ever he had gotten the <hi>Key</hi> of the <hi>Library</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his keeping, preſently, the firſt thing he did, put the Book into his Pocket, and run to the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> with it. For <hi>after</hi> he was <hi>Library-Keeper, as ſoon as</hi> they ask'd for it, they had it. And before that, the only Omiſſion of the Dr. was, that he did not upon Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s and no body's elſe ſpeaking to him of the MS (and that only now and then by the bye, as he met him by chance) employ his <hi>Intereſt</hi> at th'other end o'th' <hi>Town</hi> to borrow it for him: that is, That Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> was not more diligent in <hi>ſubſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> for Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> than Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> was, in <hi>ſolliciting</hi> for Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi> And if Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> cannot out of both his <hi>faithfull Relations,</hi> his <hi>firſt</hi> faithfull Relation, and his <hi>ſecond</hi> faithfull Relation, make any thing more of the matter than this: he muſt e'en to work again, once more expoſe himſelf in print, and fall to <hi>clubbing</hi> for a <hi>third</hi> fiathfull Relation. The <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>fact</hi> (and I know what I ſay) in all this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie with Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> when once it comes to be ſqueez'd, contracts into as narrow a compaſs as the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> and is (I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to ſpeak it) all over <hi>Miſrepreſentation.</hi>

            <p>But the grand Article of their Accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dr. in reference to the MS, and that with which Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> was pleaſed to commence his <hi>Critical War</hi> upon the <hi>Library-Keeper</hi> at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, is ſtill behind, his <hi>Rude</hi> and haſty way of recalling it.

            <p>From whence I argue thus. <hi>If the Dr. had</hi> ſet me <hi>ſo ſhort a time,</hi> when he <hi>put the MS. into my hands, it is</hi> utterly improbable, <hi>that I ſhould not have given notice of it to Mr.</hi> Gibſon; <hi>eſpecially</hi> apprehending <hi>the Collation to be a work of</hi> more trouble <hi>than really it was, and</hi> knowing <hi>Mr.</hi> Gibſon's hands to be ſo full of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Buſineſs <hi>But that Mr.</hi> Gibſon <hi>had no ſuch</hi> notice <hi>from the appears from this Certificate. Coll.</hi> Your Argument reduced into Form, I think runs thus. If Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> at the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the MS. had given me any notice how ſoon it was to be reſtored, and bid me <hi>loſe no time,</hi> but <hi>make all the Diſpatch I could;</hi> 'tis <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly improbable,</hi> that I ſhould not have given the like notice to Mr. <hi>Gibſon;</hi> but no ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice did I give to Mr. <hi>Gibſon;</hi> therefore 'tis <hi>utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable,</hi> that Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> ſhould have given me any ſuch notice.</p>
            <p>Now in this ſame <hi>Appendix</hi> of Mr. <hi>Bennet's</hi> p 107. I meet with part of a Letter from Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> to his <hi>Sollicitor</hi> of the <hi>Half-Moon,</hi> dated <hi>May</hi> the 1ſt. 1694. and beginning in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am almoſt aſhamed to trouble you any more, Mr.</hi> Bennet, <hi>about the MS. I wiſh I had it: But, if at all, I muſt have it</hi> very quickly.</p>
            <p>From whence I argue thus; if Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> had received any ſuch <hi>Letter</hi> from Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106337:92"/>the Collation of the MS. to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him with the utmoſt Expedition, it is <hi>utterly improbable,</hi> that he ſhould not have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſome notice of it to Mr. <hi>Gibſon;</hi> but <hi>no</hi> ſuch notice did Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> give to Mr. <hi>Gibſon;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>no ſuch Letter</hi> did he receive from Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think this Argument of mine runs exactly parallel with that of Mr. <hi>Bennet.</hi> But 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> did receive ſuch a <hi>Letter</hi> from Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> requiring the Collation of the MS. to be procured for him with the utmoſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, and yet gave Mr. <hi>Gibſon</hi> no ſuch notice; therefore it is <hi>not at all improbable,</hi> but that, at the Delivery of the MS. he may have received the like <hi>Intimation</hi> from Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> with the like indifference.</p>
            <p>Upon this Certificate of Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor therefore I may remark. Firſt, that it doth <hi>not</hi> prove what Mr. <hi>Bennet affirms,</hi> that is, That the Dr. did not, at the Delivery of the MS. given Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> any Intimation how ſoon it was to be reſtored: Which this <hi>Certificate</hi> of Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Collator no More proves, than it doth, that Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> never received any ſuch Letter from Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi> What Mr <hi>Bennet</hi> therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, That this <hi>Certificate</hi> of his <hi>Collator</hi> doth <hi>not</hi> prove; No, not ſo much as to an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. But Secondly, what Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> would fain deny; That it <hi>doth</hi> prove beyond the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Contradiction. Which is, that tho' the <hi>Library-Keeper at St.</hi> James's bears the blame, yet, <hi>'tis as clear as the</hi> San, the <hi>Bookſeller</hi> at <hi>the Half-Moon</hi> was the only Perſon in fault, that Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> was <hi>diſappointed</hi> of the uſe of the MS. <hi>Witneſs.</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Letter, Mr. <hi>Gibſon</hi>'s Certificate.</p>
            <pb n="166" facs="tcp:106337:93"/>
            <p>Here's a Letter from Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> to his <hi>Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> requiring the Affair of the MS. to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedited for him with the utmoſt Diſpatch; I <hi>muſt have it, if at all,</hi> very quickly. Who'd have expected now upon the receipt of this Letter but that Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> ſhould forthwith, the firſt thing he did, have poſted away to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to have acquainted the Dr. with Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s occaſions? But no ſuch thing was done.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 103.</note> The Dr. liv'd at a <hi>Diſtance</hi> from <hi>Paul's Church-Tard;</hi> and 'twas not (as he himſelf hath told us) Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s way of <hi>Solliciting</hi> to take <hi>Journeys,</hi> or run on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body's Errands. His way of <hi>Solliciting</hi> was only to ſpeak to the Dr. now and then about the MS. <hi>occaſionally,</hi> and as he met him by chance Nor could the preſſing Inſtances of this Letter of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s, of <hi>May</hi> the 1ſt. put him out of his Pace. He is ſtill content to wait till the Dr. ſhould <hi>chance,</hi> to come that way, and <hi>either ſtep into his Shop, or paſs by the Door,</hi> and he ſhould <hi>chance</hi> to be in the way to ſpeak to him.

               </gap> but as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Letter was luckily dated juſt about that <hi>particular nick of time,</hi> that the Dr. was entring upon the full Poſſeſſion of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it being now in his <hi>Power</hi> to lend the MS. accordingly, not many days after the receipt of this letter, the Dr. comes to Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him to ſend his Prentice to the Library for it, and delivers it. And what doth Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> do with it when he hath it? He commits the <hi>Collating</hi> of it to a perſon whoſe hands he <hi>knew to be ſo full of other Buſineſs, that</hi> he could not make any tolerable Diſpatch with it: a <hi>Corrector to a Preſs, who could</hi> allow (as Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> moſt

               <hi>For the</hi> true Reaſon <hi>of Mr.</hi> Gibſon's <hi>being ſo much behind hand in the Collation, was becauſe the Preſs employ'd him, and left him no hours to himſelf, but in the Evening: And</hi> becauſe <hi>he had not been careful to make the [very] beſt uſe of thoſe.

But as for you and your Collator, divide the Fault between your ſelves upon as equal Terms as you can; though, I think, you have fairly diſcharg'd Mr. <hi>Gibſon.</hi> That Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> ſhould bear the blame, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unreaſonable. But 'twas not Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s buſineſs to ſee Faults in their right places.</p>
            <pb n="168" facs="tcp:106337:94"/>
            <p>We have ſeen here one Inſtance of Mr. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s Talent at <hi>denying</hi> a thing <hi>very poſitively:</hi> I cannot forbear preſenting the Reader with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame kind.</p>
            <p>The Dr. had ſaid, That when the MS. was delivered to him, <hi>He had not the leaſt Suſpicion, that the Collation was not finiſhed.</hi> They had, had <hi>more days to compare it in, than they needed hours; the Bearer at the Delivery of it intimated nothing to the contrary;</hi> if they had had any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for the <hi>farther uſe</hi> of it, he might have expected, upon his Return to the Library, which was ſeveral Months before Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Book was Printed, to have heard <hi>farther</hi> from them; which he not having done, what reaſon had he to think, but that they had finiſhed their whole work with it?</p>
            <p>This however was a <hi>Circumſtance,</hi> there was a neceſſity of their Denying, and that <hi>very</hi> poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. Which therefore Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> has done in the following Form of words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With what Conſcience can the Dr. pretend to ſay, That when the MS. was carryed down to him at</hi> VVeſtminſter <hi>[a little afterwards] he had</hi> no Suſpicions, that the <hi>Collation was not finiſhed?</hi> Unleſs he means, <hi>That he did not ſuſpect it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he</hi> moſt certainly knew <hi>it. GOD forgive him this</hi> Untruth; <hi>which with ſeveral others, I hope, before he goes out of the World, he'll be ſo juſt, both to himſelf and</hi> me, <hi>as to retract pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is not this denying a thing <hi>very</hi> poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Now muſt I crave Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Pardon if I tell him, That what he here ſo <hi>poſitively</hi> avers for a <hi>certainty,</hi> is not only an <hi>uncertainty,</hi> but an abſolute <hi>Impoſſibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="169" facs="tcp:106337:94"/>
            <p>But how can that be? Will Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> ſay,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V. p.</hi> 124</note> Doth not the <hi>Certificate</hi> of my <hi>Collator</hi> expreſly confirm it?—<hi>I very well remember</hi>—Here we find, that when the Dr. called upon me for the MS. and I ſent my Man to the <hi>Collator</hi>'s for it, word was brought that <hi>he had not</hi> finiſhed the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: Notwithſtanding which, the Dr. <hi>utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſes</hi> to ſpare it any longer, but ſends my Man a <hi>ſecond</hi> time for it with expreſs Orders, to have it brought to him <hi>immediately;</hi> himſelf ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my Shop and waiting the Return of it. And that, <hi>That was the true Reaſon, why Mr.</hi> Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>could Collate no more of the Epiſtles. With what Conſcience then</hi> can the Dr. pretend to ſay, that when the MS. was ſent down to him at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> (a little afterwards) he <hi>had no Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions,</hi> that the Collation was not finiſhed? For could my Collator go on with collating the MS. when the MS. it ſelf was taken out of his hands?</p>
            <p>But hold, Mr. <hi>Bennet;</hi> you are ſomewhat too haſty in your Concluſions.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 98.</note> From your <hi>own</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it appears, that it was on a <hi>Saturday Noon,</hi> That he called upon you for the MS. and was told, that the Collation was not <hi>then</hi> finiſhed. He did not thereupon forthwith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr's</hi> praef. P.</note> and <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> take it away with him, as moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would have done, had he had a <hi>private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of diſappointing</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> of the uſe of it. He only order'd you, without fail to ſend it to his Lodgings <hi>ſome time</hi> that Afternoon; beyond which time he did indeed, (and he hath given a good Reaſon, why) <hi>refuſe</hi> to leave it in your hands. So that you had ſtill <hi>half a day</hi> good; in leſs time than which (as the Dr. hath proved by an <hi>Experiment</hi> of his own making) the <hi>whole</hi> Book might have been collated, though not one
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:106337:95"/>ſtroak had been ſet to it before. Nor need we ſuppoſe your Collator able to Diſpatch ſuch a piece of work altogether, as expeditiouſly as the Dr. ſince having had it in his hands for ſo many days before, the Dr. might reaſonably then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume him nearer the end than the beginning. Nor can I imagine, but that had you repreſented to him the preſſingneſs of the occaſion, your Collator would have found means of borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Preſs</hi> three or four hours even of <hi>Day-light,</hi> to have devoted to the Service of Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi> If the MS. was taken out of your <hi>Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> hands at Noon, and if the Dr <hi>knew</hi> as much (though that is more than the Dr. remembers) yet it being left in <hi>your</hi> hands, in <hi>three</hi> or four minutes ſpace it might have been put into your <hi>Collator's</hi> again; which that it was <hi>not,</hi> was more than the Dr. could <hi>certainly know,</hi> or more than he had any reaſon to <hi>ſuſpect. Unleſs</hi> he had <hi>then</hi> moſt <hi>certainly known,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Sollicitor would have taken no more Care of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Concerns, than he now appears to have done. So that the Dr. though he was told indeed, when he called upon you for the MS. at <hi>Noon,</hi> that the Collation was not <hi>then</hi> finiſhed; yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left it in your hands at <hi>Noon,</hi> not knowing how much of it <hi>then</hi> remained unfiniſhed; nay, the Collation of the whole MS. (which is much ſhorter than the printed Book) being the work of leſs than <hi>half a day:</hi> Whether it were <hi>ſooner</hi> or <hi>later,</hi> in the Afternoon, that the Book was ſent to his Lodgings, it is <hi>Impoſſible</hi> (unleſs the Bearer had given him ſuch Information) for him, to have known, that the Collation of it was not <hi>then</hi> finiſhed. Nothing leſs, I ſay, than abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible, that he ſhould <hi>certainly have
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:106337:95"/>known</hi> it, and moſt highly unreaſonable had it been in him to have <hi>ſuſpected</hi> it. And for a Man to averr, and that ſo <hi>very poſitively</hi> as Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> here doth, for <hi>Certainties,</hi> not only <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties,</hi> but <hi>Impoſſibilities,</hi> argues as great a want of common Sence as of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Ay but, faith Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> here the Dr's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory hath fail'd him as to one particular. The Dr. ſaith, that the MS. was not returned, nor required to be returned more <hi>limitedly</hi> than on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſome time</hi> that <hi>Afternoon.</hi> But that, ſaith Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> is <hi>another ſlip</hi> of the Dr's <hi>Memory:</hi> he demanded it out of my hands at <hi>Noon,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed me the uſe of it any longer, but order'd it to be ſent to his Lodgings</hi> out of hand, as <hi>it was, a little afterwards, immediately</hi> juſt after Dinner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another ſlip of the Dr's Memory.</hi> But this <hi>ſlip of the Dr</hi>'s <hi>Memory,</hi> Sir, is a Circumſtance in which he is <hi>as poſitive as</hi> you can be to the contrary. And can you give me any tolerable reaſon for it, why I ſhould more depend upon <hi>your</hi> Memory, than upon the Dr's? In the next place, the Dr's Account of this Affair entirely agrees with your own <hi>firſt</hi> Account given us in Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Book, and with the <hi>Certificate</hi> of your <hi>Collator.</hi> And how comes the. <hi>That day</hi> of your <hi>firſt</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be in your <hi>ſecond</hi> ſhortned into <hi>a little afterwards, out of hand, immediately,</hi> even juſt <hi>after Dinner?</hi> And in the next, let any Man of common Senſe judge of the <hi>Probability</hi> of the thing. If the Dr. was in ſuch mighty haſte for the MS. that he muſt needs have it returned to him ſo inſtantly <hi>out of hand, immediately,</hi> juſt <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner;</hi> why did he not take it away with him himſelf? Or why did he not order your Man to carry it to his Lodgings <hi>out of hand, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:106337:96"/>before <hi>Dinner,</hi> as well as <hi>immediately</hi> after <hi>Dinner?</hi> Or, did you deſire him to let your Man ſtay and take his <hi>Dinner</hi> firſt? His Victuals would do him more good when 'twas hot.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Piſh!</p>
            <p>Nay, who can help it? Is there any other way of anſwering ſuch ſtuff as this, than by laughing at it? Or muſt they go on uncontradicted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there's no anſwering them without making one's Self ridiculous?</p>
            <p>And now let me make ſome few Remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this terrible <hi>Sentence,</hi> which our <hi>Bookſeller of</hi> the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> paſſes upon the Dr.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, this <hi>Sentence</hi> is pretended to be founded upon the <hi>Certificate</hi> of your <hi>Collator.</hi> But how can that <hi>Certificate</hi> of your <hi>Collator</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict the Dr. of ſo <hi>notorious an Untruth,</hi> who <hi>Denyes</hi> nothing that is in it? Or, muſt I believe the Dr. to be ſo grievous a <hi>Lyar,</hi> becauſe <hi>Some-Body</hi> hath lent Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> a <hi>Figure</hi> in <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> called, <hi>Exclamatio,</hi> to clap into his <hi>Appendix</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him?</p>
            <p>In the next place I obſerve, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this <hi>Certificate</hi> of your <hi>Collator,</hi> not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer'd in the Dr's Preface, ſaving that <hi>new</hi> Circumſtance in your <hi>ſecond</hi> Account, quite <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got</hi> to be <hi>remembred</hi> by you in your <hi>firſt.</hi> And to what purpoſe then was that Certificate of your Collator reprinted? To none other in the world, but to keep the Cauſe in heart, and dazle the Eyes of your <hi>Thoughtleſs</hi> Readers, by making a ſhew of Hands againſt the Dr. And what end is there of contending with Men. who go on Printing and Prating the ſame baffled Stuff over and over again, and will not accept of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer?</p>
            <pb n="173" facs="tcp:106337:96"/>
            <p>And Thirdly, Let any Man judge whether or no, that <hi>new</hi> Story of juſt <hi>after Dinner,</hi> be not a perfect Fiction of Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s <hi>ſecond</hi> Memory, altogether abſurd and improbable, and framed for no other end or purpoſe, than to patch up a breach in their <hi>true Story</hi> of the MS. And yet</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Plaſter is ſtill too narrow for the Sore. For how did the Dr. know (as he tells you himſelf) when your Collator ſent him word, that he had not finiſhed the Collation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but was at work upon it, that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two or three Pages ſhort of the end? And if ſo; they might have been collated while your Man was eating his <hi>Dinner.</hi> And what a leaky Cauſe have you got in hand? The more 'tis patch'd the more it draws water. But a rotten Bottom will not bear mending.</p>
            <p>And now upon the whole, let the Reader once more look upon that peremptory Sentence which this Bookſeller paſſes upon the Dr. his, <hi>With what Conſcience then,</hi> and, <hi>GOD forgive him this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth;</hi> and make what Reflections he pleaſes. Theſe Gentlemen of the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> may go on with their printing things upon the Dr. as long as they pleaſed; but they muſt not expect to be much longer believed for their <hi>bold ſpeaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But admitting your <hi>Poſtulatum;</hi> ſuppoſe that the Dr. had moſt <hi>certainly known,</hi> that when the MS. was returned to him the Collation was not finiſhed? What then?</p>
            <p>Why, was not the Dr. a very <hi>uncivil</hi> Man then, in forcing the Book out of our hands, and that though he <hi>knew</hi> the Collation was not finiſhed, and conſequently, cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Not at all, Sir. For the Queſtion is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Collation was finiſhed, or <hi>not</hi> finiſhed, when he called in the MS. and refuſed to leave it with you any longer; nor whether the Dr. <hi>knew,</hi> or <hi>not</hi> knew as much: but whether he did not, <hi>as ſoon as it</hi> came to be in his <hi>Power, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily</hi> ſupply you with the uſe of it; whether or no you had it not in your hands long enough to have collated it over and over, and by whoſe Fault it was, that the Collation was not finiſhed before the MS. was called in; whether or no he had not ſome <hi>other</hi> Reaſon for his calling it in when he did, than a <hi>Deſign</hi> of <hi>diſappointing</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> of the uſe of it; and whether or no his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing at <hi>that time</hi> to leave it in your hands <hi>any longer,</hi> ought in Reaſon to have been interpreted as want of Reſpect to a perſon of that honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Name and Quality. Theſe are the Queries to which you ought to give a more ſatisfactory Anſwer, than I have yet met with, e're you will be able to juſtifie the Clamours you have raiſed upon the Dr. for his refuſing you at <hi>that time</hi> the <hi>farther uſe</hi> of the MS.

                  </gap>ore he would not</hi> Truſt <hi>it out of</hi> thoſe Walls one day longer. And here's a Flouriſh for you, and that's all. <hi>One
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106337:97"/>day</hi> longer! No, Sir; not <hi>one day</hi> longer, but ſome <hi>Months</hi> longer; paſſing from hand to hand, and not without Danger of miſcarriage. I would ſeriouſly ask Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> and let his own Thoughts make the Anſwer; ought the Dr. to have left the Library for ſo many <hi>Months</hi> together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing the MS. returned into it before he went? Would he himſelf, had he been in the Dr's place, have ran ſuch a risk? Why then, doth he fall ſo foul upon the Dr. for doing That which in the Dr's place, no Man would not have done? The <hi>Truſting</hi> the MS. out of <hi>thoſe Walls</hi> at all, was ſomewhat adventurouſly done of the Dr. and ought not to have been received for ſo <hi>Common</hi> a Favour; the calling it in again upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he did, would not, I <hi>dare ſay,</hi> have been <hi>reſented</hi> by any Man in <hi>England,</hi> ſave Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> as an Affront; nor, to deal plainly with him, by him neither, but that he was reſolved to pick a Quarrel with the Dr. and wanted a better Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>There was no need therefore of the Dr's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting that Story, <hi>That when the MS. was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him, he had not the leaſt Suſpicion, but that the Collation was finiſhed.</hi> His Reply to Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> had been ſufficient without it. That as <hi>ſoon as it</hi> was in his Power, he <hi>voluntarily</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd them with the uſe of it; that they had it in their hands, more <hi>days</hi> than the collating of it required <hi>hours;</hi> that when at near a <hi>Weeks</hi> end (and the whole was not the work of half a day) he called upon them to have it reſtored, he could not have expected to have found the Collation unfiniſhed; that he was not <hi>then</hi> at the Liberty of ſparing it them <hi>any longer;</hi> but that they might have had it again for asking. This
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106337:98"/>had been Anſwer enough of all Conſcience to the <hi>Paſſage in Mr.</hi> Boyle's <hi>Preface.</hi> There was no need therefore of the Dr's having recourſe to Fiction, when he had Truth enough to have ſerved his turn. But though there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Dr's feigning this Story, if it had been really true; yet Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> being reſolved to ſtand to what he had done, there was a neceſſity of his denying it, and that as Authentically as poſſible. And the Dr. having in his Preface ſhewn, that Mr. <hi>Boyle's</hi> Evidences were nothing to the purpoſe, a neceſſity alſo there was for Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s, in his <hi>Appendix,</hi> betaking himſelf to his <hi>Recollecting</hi> Faculty, and ſtarting up that <hi>new</hi> Circumſtance. Upon which, I ſhall only make this ſhort Reflection; that if the Dr. feigned this Story, he is one of thoſe Men who delight <hi>to tell Lyes to no manner of purpoſe:</hi> But upon Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> as to this particular, I cannot paſs the ſame Cenſure. If this <hi>after</hi> Story of juſt <hi>after. Dinner</hi> be a Lye, as I verily believe it is; I can not ſay as the Dr. upon alike occaſion did; that 'tis a <hi>Silly</hi> one: No, 'twas a <hi>Neceſſary</hi> one, and the only Refuge he had left him.</p>
            <p>Well, ſaith the Dr. and ſuppoſe the Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not finiſhed, when the MS. was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, could they not upon my Return to the Library, which was ſeveral Months before Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Book was Printed, have asked me for it again?</p>
            <p>To this by way of Anſwer they return a parcel of words; and nothing but words.</p>
            <p>The Dr. ſaith Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 98.</note>

            <pb n="177" facs="tcp:106337:98"/>
            <p>That is, the Dr. did not <hi>bid</hi> you borrow the Book of him again. As why ſhould he, when he thought you had done your whole work with it?</p>

               <hi>Yes, I could (have asked for it again) and have been denied it again, which I was not very willing to venture.

            <p>Handſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I confeſs, and Majeſtically delivered; but <hi>falſe</hi> Suggeſtion all over.

Your not vouchſafing to renew your Requeſt, nay, or ſo much as to ſignifie your Deſire, and yet proclaiming your ſelf in Print denied the <hi>farther uſe of it,</hi> is an Action which all the <hi>Phraſe</hi> in the world cannot excuſe from being <hi>unjuſt.</hi>

            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:106337:99"/>
            <p>Nay, and after all ſuppoſe the Dr. had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely refuſed to lend them the MS. at all: Suppoſe (as a Man <hi>leſs obliging</hi> than himſelf would have done) he had cut off Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> with this ſhort Anſwer: <q>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> is a Peron known to me only by the name of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, a Name for which I have the greateſt Veneration; but I wonder that Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> ſhould underſtand things no better, than to think, that it lyes in my Power to part with a MS. out of the King's Library without ſome better Warrant for it, than barely a young <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Scholar's ſending his Bookſeller to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it of me.</q> Suppoſe, I ſay, the Dr. had given ſuch an Anſwer, and thereupon Mr. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> had ſent his Letter of Complaint to <hi>Chriſt-Church:</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> might indeed have interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as a kind of Reprimand to himſelf, for his being a little too <hi>uncourtly</hi> in his <hi>Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> but durſt he thereupon have printed a Book upon the Dr.? Durſt he have Libell'd and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his Majeſty's <hi>Library-Keeper,</hi> for keeping to the Rules of his Office, and refuſing to be at the Command, I will not ſay of Mr. <hi>Bryle</hi> himſelf, but of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Bookſeller? Or could the bare <hi>Denial</hi> of a <hi>Favour,</hi> have juſtified ſuch a kind of Retaliation: a <hi>Favour,</hi> according to the methods Mr. <hi>Bayle</hi> took of obtaining it, ſo unreaſonable to be expected? A <hi>Favour</hi> ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, ſo coldly, ſo ſuperficially asked, that the not receiving it could ſcarce deſerve the Name of a <hi>Denial.</hi> I ſhall not ſcruple therefore to ſay, how much ſoever a Paradox it may ſeem to thoſe who have been ſo artificially poſſeſt with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Story, That Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> was <hi>obliging</hi> even to an Exceſs to a Perſon, who neither knew
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:106337:99"/>how to requeſt a Favour like a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> not (as the Event hath proved) to requite it but with Injuries. I had not allow'd my ſelf this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Speech with a perſon of his Quality, had not he himſelf been pleaſed to accumulate his <hi>firſt</hi> Act of Unjuſtice, by a greater one of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending it; not only by ſuffering his <hi>Popular</hi> Name to ſtand in the Frontiſpiece of ſo wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Libel as is that I have been conſidering, but alſo by perſiſting to patronize this Lazy, Sawcy <hi>Bookſeller</hi> of his, who begun that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Quarrel, with which neither of the Parties have much cauſe to be ſatisfied, but which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit of Prophecy, I dare adventure to foretel them, when they have done their worſt, will end little to the advantage of the Aggreſſor.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Library-Keeper</hi> of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, <hi>uncivil</hi> Man as he was!

            <p>How can that be, ſaith the Dr. That <hi>Library-Keeper</hi> you ſpeak of was not ſo much as <hi>one Month,</hi> no, not <hi>half</hi> a <hi>Month Library-Keeper,</hi> before he <hi>voluntarily</hi> came and offered it (Dr. <hi>B</hi>'s Preface.)</p>
            <p>Who ſays he was <hi>Library-Keeper</hi> all that while? But he liv'd near the Royal Library, he was acquainted with thoſe worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that then had the keeping of the Key, and bore them Company ſometimes when they went into the Library. (Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s <hi>ſecond</hi> Acount.)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Library Keeper</hi> at St. <hi>James</hi>'s denied a perſon of Mr. <hi>Bayle</hi>'s Quality ſo <hi>common</hi> a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> as the uſe of one of the King's MS. (Their <hi>firſt</hi> Account.)</p>
            <p>How could I <hi>lend</hi> them the MS. before it was in my <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>lend</hi> it them? (The Dr's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face)</p>
            <pb n="181" facs="tcp:106337:100"/>
            <p>Who ſays, you could have <hi>lent</hi> it us much <hi>ſooner</hi> than you did? But you might have <hi>got</hi> it to be <hi>lent</hi> to us. (Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s <hi>ſecond</hi> Account.)</p>
            <p>'Twas not without <hi>great Difficulties,</hi> that we at <hi>laſt</hi> procured the MS. nor till after a <hi>long Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation.</hi> (Mr. <hi>bennet</hi>'s <hi>firſt</hi> Account)</p>
            <p>What doth this Man mean by his <hi>great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties?</hi> The <hi>greateſt Difficulty</hi> that even I put him too was that of ſending his Man to fetch it. <hi>Sollicitation! One would imagine that he had worn out the Streets with frequent</hi> Journeys <hi>to ſollicit for the MS. I don't remember that either he or his Apprentice came once to my Lodgings, or to the Library for it, till the time that he ſent for't by my Appointment, and received it.</hi> (Dr. <hi>B</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.)</p>
            <p>Who ſays, I <hi>did?</hi> That was not my way of <hi>Solliciting,</hi> to take <hi>Journeys.</hi> But I ſpake to you of it I know not how many times as you came in my way, not <hi>either ſtept into my Shop, or paſs'd by the Door. Twenty</hi> times at <hi>leaſt.</hi> (Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s <hi>ſecond</hi> Account)</p>
            <p>He took the MS. out of our hands before the Collation was finiſhed, and though he was told as much, yet he <hi>utterly refuſed</hi> to leave it with us <hi>any longer,</hi> but demanded to have it ſent to his Lodgings <hi>that very day</hi> (Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s <hi>firſt</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.)</p>
            <p>True: For I was obliged to ſee it returned into the Library <hi>that very day.</hi> But 'twas ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own Account at <hi>Noon,</hi> that I called upon you for the MS. and was told that Collation was not <hi>then</hi> finiſhed.

            <pb n="182" facs="tcp:106337:101"/>
            <p>Oh! This <hi>Lyar!</hi> Not the <hi>leaſt Suſpicion!</hi> He <hi>moſt certainly knew</hi> the contrary? My Collator expreſly ſent him word, that he had not finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Collation.</p>
            <p>Ay, but that was <hi>Noon,</hi> I did not (even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own Account) forthwith and <hi>immediately</hi> take it away with me; I left it in your hands, only ordering you to ſend it after me ſome time that <hi>Afternoon</hi> without fail; and the whole might have been collated twice over in half a day.</p>
            <p>Oh abominable!</p>
            <p>Why that's all you your ſelf ſay, in your <hi>firſt</hi> Account. That I refuſed to ſpare it you <hi>any longer,</hi> that is, <hi>any longer</hi> than <hi>that day:</hi> which is true; for that <hi>Evening</hi> is part of <hi>that Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Evening!</hi> Oh this wicked Man? Well; <hi>God forgive him.</hi> He commanded me to ſend it to his Lodgings <hi>forthwith, out of hand, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,</hi> juſt <hi>after Dinner;</hi> I <hi>proteſt.</hi> And he ſays, not till the <hi>cloſe of the Evening. God forgive him this untruth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why, Sir, time was when you your ſelf ſaid no more. (Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s <hi>firſt</hi> Account.)</p>
            <p>Ay, but when I ſaw the Dr's Preface, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <hi>recollected</hi> the matter a little better. 'Twas juſt after <hi>Dinner,</hi> I <hi>ſincerely declare.</hi> (Mr. <hi>Benner</hi>'s <hi>ſecond</hi> Account.)</p>
            <p>But doth not a Cauſe look very ſuſpiciouſly, that is always changing its Colours thus? Hath <hi>Sincerity</hi> ſo mutable a Face?</p>
            <p>And thus much for this <hi>tedious Story of the</hi> MS. that <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> with their Flouriſhes upon which the <hi>Terraef filius</hi>'s of the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> have raiſed ſuch <hi>Huzza</hi>'s upon the <hi>Liorary-kerper</hi> at St. <hi>Jomes</hi>'s. There is not, I think, any
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106337:101"/>material Circumſtance in the whole, upon which I have not beſtow'd as much (and I fear more) Conſideration as it deſerves. And as for the <hi>Siliy</hi> Suggeſtions with which Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> hath ſtull'd out every Page of his <hi>Appendix,</hi> to have anſwered them more particularly, had been an Impertinence almoſt as inexcuſable as that of writing them.

As I go all along only upon the bottom of their own Prints, and as I have no where repreſented the matter otherwiſe, than exactly according to my own Apprehenſion concerning it: So I cannot but perſwade my ſelf, that any Man who ſhall give himſelf the trouble of comparing their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts will fall in with me in the ſame Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that throughout this whole <hi>Phalaridan</hi> Controverſie, the <hi>Learning,</hi> the <hi>Civility,</hi>

            <p>Having diſpatchd this grand Affair, the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact,</hi> I might now think my work at an end with Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> and his <hi>Appendix.</hi> Some few <hi>ſtraggling</hi> Calumnies however there are here and there intermixed with his <hi>faithful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> which to paſs over altogether unobſerved might ſtill leave the Reader under the Opinion, that there are in this <hi>Appendix</hi> of Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s at leaſt one or two <hi>Truths:</hi> Eſpecially when he finds them not only ſo conſidently averr'd, but ſome of them alſo, to appearance, ſo firmly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted.</p>
            <p>For this is one of the methods by which the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> ſo ſucceſsfully carry on their Controverſie with the Dr. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

            <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s firſt Letter, p. 101.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>I am glad you had the good Fortune to preſerve any of my</hi> Letters <hi>relating to the</hi> Manuſcript <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi> in St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Library.—I am as</hi> fully ſatisfied <hi>of the</hi> Truth <hi>of what</hi> You <hi>have ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> that Occaſion, <hi>as I am of the</hi> Falſhood <hi>of what Dr.</hi> Bentley <hi>hath ſaid upon</hi> That, <hi>and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be counted an <hi>Uncivil</hi> thing in me, to diſturb Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s <hi>Satisfactions;</hi> but ſince he is for ſo plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I muſt as plainly tell him, That <hi>what Dr.</hi> Bentley <hi>hath ſaid upon</hi> that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is moſt undoubtedly <hi>True.</hi> For the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> is here ſpeaking of, is that <hi>falſe</hi> Account of Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s, Printed in Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s admired <hi>Phraſe-Book</hi> upon the Library Keeper at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, concerning the <hi>nine</hi> Months <hi>Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> In anſwer to which Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> hath <hi>ſaid</hi> (nor hath he <hi>ſaid</hi> it only, but <hi>prov'd</hi> it alſo) that that uncivil <hi>Library-Keeper</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s whole Book runs ſo hard upon, was not ſo much as <hi>one</hi> Month <hi>Keeper</hi> of the <hi>Library</hi> at St. <hi>James</hi>'s before he ſupplyed Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> with the MS. for the uſe of Mr. <hi>Boyle:</hi> And that as for that <hi>Sollicitation</hi> Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> ſpeaks of, with all his <hi>Solliciting,</hi> he never ſo much as once gave himſelf the trouble of going or ſending to the Dr's Lodgings upon Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Concerns, ſaving that one time, when by the Dr's <hi>own</hi> Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſent his Man to the Library for the Book, and received it. This is all the Dr. hath ſaid upon <hi>that Occaſion;</hi> and both theſe things

I again therefore, after the Dr. affirm it; that Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s <hi>firſt</hi> Account, in Juſtification of which Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> here appears, is (at leaſt as 'tis managed in Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Book) a <hi>falſe</hi> Account, at leaſt, a foul, partial, and diſguiſed Account; and being ſo contrived on purpoſe to <hi>miſlead the Reader,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ap.</hi> p. 133.</note> and that not in a <hi>Trifling,</hi> but in the <hi>very Principal</hi> Circumſtances of the Fact, to which it belongs; it may very juſtly be called a <hi>falſe</hi> Account, as directly deſigning to create in the Rader a <hi>falſe</hi> Opinion. And ſuch moſt plainly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably it is. I might alſo obſerve, that could Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> have produced a Copy of any Letter of his <hi>own,</hi> written to the Dr. <hi>himſelf</hi> upon the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of the <hi>Manuſcript</hi> Phalaris <hi>at St.</hi> James<hi>'s,</hi> it had been much more to the purpoſe than his referring us to Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s File. I might alſo <hi>Query,</hi> how early doth the name of Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> appear upon Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s File? What? <hi>nine Months</hi> before they had the MS. But all this we have had over before <hi>Sup.</hi> p. 147.151. And thus much for the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s firſt Letter. No, Sir; what Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> hath ſaid upon <hi>that Occaſion</hi> is <hi>not a Falſhood,</hi> but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:106337:103"/>
               <hi>Truth.</hi> But I cannot leave this firſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without one Remark upon Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s very cautious way of expreſſing himſelf. <hi>I am as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of the Truth of Mr.</hi> Bennet's <hi>Account, as I am of the Falſhood of Dr.</hi> Bentley's. Now, with the Gentleman's good leave, I would ask him, what this amounts to? I my ſelf and every Man in <hi>England,</hi> are <hi>as</hi> fully fatisfied of the one, <hi>as</hi> of the other; and yet Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> muſt not infer from hence, that we are at all ſatisfied of either of them: I am <hi>as</hi> fully fatisfied, that Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> writ the late Defence of <hi>Phalaris, as</hi> I am that Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> writ the Appendix <hi>that he has ſet his hand to.</hi> This I can truly ſay I am fully <hi>ſatisfied in;</hi> and yet notwithſtanding this <hi>full ſatisfaction,</hi> I have ſome Scruples concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Author of that Defence of <hi>Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> eſpecially when I conſider this very <hi>Letter,</hi> and a certain Copy of Verſes before the <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</hi>

                  <head>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s <hi>ſecond</hi> Letter, p. 107.</head>
                  <p>I am almoſt aſham'd to trouble you any more, Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> about the MS. I wiſh, I had it: But, if at all, I muſt have it very quickly. And though I can do pretty well without it, yet Dr. <hi>Bentley's Rudeneſs</hi> is not the leſs.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>And here's another Complement upon the Dr. Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s <hi>Rudeneſs.</hi> But wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted this <hi>Rudeneſs</hi> of the Dr's? Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> hath been pleaſed in the words immediately following to explain it. <hi>A little before this, it ſeems, I had given Mr.</hi> Boyle <hi>an Account of Dr.</hi> Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's <hi>diſobliging</hi> Delays <hi>and</hi> Expreſſions. The <hi>Rudeneſs</hi> therefore, here complained of conſiſted in; Firſt his <hi>Diſobliging Delays,</hi> and Secondly, his <hi>Diſobliging Expreſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:106337:104"/>
            <p>And firſt as to his diſobliging <hi>Delays.</hi> Now this <hi>Letter</hi> of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s was dated, <hi>Oxford, May</hi> 1ſt. when the Dr. was not yet actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the Poſſeſſion of his Office. And that Information which Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> had ſent down to <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> againſt the Dr. was drawn up ſome time before. So that the diſobliging <hi>Delays</hi> of which Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> had been making his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> were the Dr's not <hi>Lending</hi> them the MS. <hi>before</hi> it was in his <hi>Power</hi> to lend it them: Of which enough already.</p>
            <p>But here might I ask Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> a Queſtion or two. 'Twas not you ſay till after <hi>nine</hi> Months Sollicitation, that you <hi>at laſt</hi> obtained the uſe of the MS. Nor till after at leaſt <hi>twenty</hi> times ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it. But why did you not after your hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been <hi>one, two, three, four, five, ſix, ſeven, eight</hi> Months <hi>delay'd</hi> by the Dr. try ſome other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods? Why did you not after having been <hi>once, twice, thrice,</hi> twenty <hi>times</hi> diſappointed by the Dr. make ſome Enquiry where the matter ſtuck? This had been the part of a faithful <hi>Scl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor,</hi> and had prevented this unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie in its Original. And a little Enquiry would have informed you, where the Key of the Library was lodg'd for the greateſt part of thoſe <hi>nine</hi> Months, and who had been the proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom to have made your Application. If therefore you did <hi>not</hi> know the then State of the Royal Library, it muſt have been for want of Enquiry, and a Proof of your Sloth and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference as to Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Concerns. If you <hi>did</hi> know it, and yet wrote ſuch a Letter to Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> againſt the Dr. what can we call it but a delight in doing miſchief? But I hvae Charity enough to impute it to the former; your <hi>Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:106337:104"/>only. For 'twas an eaſier thing to ſit ſtill behind the Counter and write <hi>Letters</hi> to Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> than to take <hi>Journeys,</hi> and run from <hi>Paul</hi>'s-<hi>Church-Yard</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> a borrowing the Book for him your ſelf. Your Letter, to which this of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s is an Anſwer, was written, you tell us, probably, <hi>in the very latter end of</hi> April: But a Letter then written, to have given a fair Account of the matter; ſhould have been to this purpoſe. <q>I have ſpoken to Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times about the MS. and he hath faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promiſed to <hi>help me to it:</hi> But his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent hath not yet paſs'd all its Formalities, ſo that he is not as yet poſſeſs'd of the Key of the Library; But hopes within a ſhort time to be ſo. And then we ſhall take Care to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer your Expectations. Though by the bye, as I have been ſpeaking to him of the MS. I have heard him now and then paſs an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward kind of Ceaſure upon your Author. 'Tis a <hi>Spurious and contemptible</hi> piece, he ſays, and not worthy of a new Edition, and thinks, as I have ſometimes heard him ſay, you might better beſrow your time than in throwing it away upon ſuch an unediſying undertaking.</q> Had Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> written ſuch a Letter as this, it had been a fair Account, nor could Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> have juſtly taken offence at it: And if he wrote <hi>more</hi> than this, I very conſidently preſume he was a <hi>falſe</hi> Informer. For,</p>
            <p>Secondly, what can we reaſonable ſuppoſe to have been theſe <hi>diſobliging Expreſſions</hi> the Dr. uſed concerning Mr. <hi>Bayle.</hi> The Dr. was at that time a perfect Stranger to Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> and his <hi>Qualities,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> the ſame to the Dr. It cannot therefore have been any perſonal Pique
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:106337:105"/>againſt him, and ſure he cannot have deſpiſed him for the ſake of his <hi>Name.</hi> What then can have been theſe <hi>diſobliging Expreſſions?</hi> None o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I dare ſay, than what I have been juſt now touching upon; the Cenſure the Dr. may have paſs'd upon not Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s perſon, but his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; and ſo Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> himſelf, both in this very Page (107.) and in his <hi>firſt</hi> Account is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to explain it. The many <hi>ſlight and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things Dr.</hi> Bentley <hi>threw out now and then, both upon him</hi> (<hi>Mr.</hi> Boyle) <hi>and the</hi> Work <hi>he was about: and, the</hi> Reflections <hi>the Dr. made from time to time, when I ſpake to him from Mr.</hi> Boyle <hi>for the</hi> uſe of the MS. (p. 99.) And after the ſame manner is the matter reported in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Dr. <hi>King.</hi> Theſe <hi>Reflections</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all along terminate upon <hi>him,</hi> with regard to the <hi>Work he was about,</hi> the collating of MSS. and the <hi>Editing</hi> of a <hi>ſpurious and contemptible Author:</hi>

               <hi>then</hi> Capacity; and Secondly, for affording him ſo ſlender an Aſſiſtance in it: nor is the Scholar anſwerable for the miſtaken methods of his Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. And for a Man either to feign an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front where there is none given, or to aggravate things beyond meaſure, only to execute the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges of a party, or to expoſe to the World his Stock of <hi>Phraſe</hi> and Witticiſms, is as <hi>ungentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man like</hi> an uſe of the Pen, as picking Quarrels in the Streets is of the Sword.</p>
            <p>And thus much for Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s two firſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimonies againſt the Dr, theſe two Letters from Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> the <hi>Falſhood</hi> charged upon him in the former, and the <hi>Rudeneſs</hi> in the latter.

               <hi>This is to Certifie, That</hi> Phalaris<hi>'s Epiſtles, in Greek and Latin, put out by the Honourable</hi> Charles Boyle, <hi>Eſquire, were Printed by me at my own Coſt and Charges; and neither Mr.</hi> Bennet, <hi>nor any other Bookſeller was any ways concerned in it.

               <hi>I utterly deny,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That ever I ſpake a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to him tending that way, and 'tis</hi> improbable to the higheſt degree <hi>that every I ſhould.</hi> And ſo comes in Mr. <hi>Crooke</hi>'s Certificate, to ſhew, That the <hi>Book was Printed altogether at another Man's Coſt and Charges,</hi> and near the whole Impreſſion, when finiſhed, Sold to Mr. <hi>Croſsley</hi> Bookſeller in <hi>Oxford;</hi> from him had Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> fifty Books at firſt; and a few more, ſome years afterwards, from another hand; but in the whole a far <hi>leſs number</hi> than he commonly uſes of any <hi>Oxford</hi> Impreſſion: Therefore there can have been no ſuch Diſcourſe between him and the Dr. as that, <hi>He ſhould have asked the Dr's Opinion concerning the Book, whether he thought it would be a vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble piece,</hi> and that he ſhould tell the Dr. <hi>That he had a Concern in the Impreſſion, and hop'd it would Sell well. I</hi> utterly <hi>deny,</hi> that <hi>ever I ſpake a</hi> Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>to him tending this way, and 'tis</hi> improbable to the higheſt degree <hi>that ever I ſhould.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the firſt place, that Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> ſhould have had ſo very frequent occaſions to Diſcourſe with the Dr. about the Epiſties of <hi>Phalaris</hi> when they were in the Preſs, and yet never have <hi>asked him his Opinion concerning them;</hi> that Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> I ſay, during his <hi>nine</hi> MOnths Sollicitation for the <hi>manuſcript-Phalaris,</hi> and in all the <hi>at leaſt twenty times</hi> asking him for it; yet all this while ſhould never ſo much as once ſpeak one Syllable to him tending towards the learning <hi>his Opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Book:</hi> This, to my Apprehenſion, is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, even to the higheſt Degree.</hi> The Dr. <hi>was pleaſed to conſult Mr.</hi> Bennet <hi>ſome times in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:106337:107"/>his way</hi> of a <hi>Bookſeller:</hi> And is it not ſomewhat ſtrange that Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> ſhould never have taken his turn of conſulting the Dr. ſometimes in <hi>his</hi> way of a <hi>Scholar.</hi> This was an Omiſſion ſcarce any Bookſeller in <hi>England,</hi> beſids Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> would have been guilty of. And <hi>this</hi> is the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance upon which the very ſtreſs of the Dr's Relation depends, Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s <hi>asking him his Opinion concerning the Book;</hi> for 'twas <hi>that</hi> part of the Diſcourſe occaſioned the Dr's paſſing that <hi>Reflection</hi> upon Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s undertaking. Whether Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> told the Dr. that he <hi>was concerned in the Impreſſion</hi> or not, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hoped, <hi>ti would</hi> Sell <hi>well,</hi> is little ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial. Upon which I muſt take the Liberty of repeating Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s own words upon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 120;</note> If the Dr. invented theſe little <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary</hi> Circumſtances, <hi>we muſt believe him to be out of his Wits, and that he loves to tell Lyes to no manner of purpoſe, and when 'tis in every Bodies Power to trace him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Secondly, was Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> never concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Sale</hi> of a Book, and intereſted to wiſh it might prove a <hi>vendible</hi> Commodity, which was <hi>altegether Printed at the Coſt and Charges of another man?</hi> The Book was Printed at the ſole Coſt of Mr. <hi>Crooke,</hi> and yet Mr. <hi>Croſsley</hi> ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to take off <hi>near the whole Impreſſion.</hi> And may not Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> himſelf have had ſome ſuch Deſign in his Head? And may not that have been the meaning of his asking the Dr's <hi>Opinion</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Book? And may he not thereupon have mentioned his <hi>Hopes</hi> of its proving a <hi>Salea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> piece? And may not that indifferent Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter the Dr. gave him of the Book have made him more wary how he over-loaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:106337:107"/>with Copies of it, and have prov'd the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of his <hi>uſing a fewer number of them</hi> than he commonly doth of other <hi>Oxford</hi> Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? And what ſignifies it, whether he ſaid in expreſs and direct Terms, I <hi>am</hi> concerned in the Impreſſion, or, I <hi>think</hi> I ſhall be concerned in it, or, I <hi>would</hi> be concerned in it, if I had but good Hopes, it would prove a <hi>vendible</hi> Book? May not Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> as well have expreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf loſely in <hi>any</hi> tone or other of theſe, or ſuch like Terms, as the Dr. hath related it in <hi>one</hi> of them? And what difference doth this make as to the ſubſtance of the thing, and the <hi>occaſion</hi> for which the Dr. produces it? I can only <hi>Query</hi> Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> upon this Head. There is not, I think, in any of theſe things an <hi>utter Improbability.</hi> But that Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> ſhould never have ſpoken <hi>one Syllable</hi> tending towards his ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dr's <hi>Opinion concerning the Book,</hi> which is the Clauſe upon which the whole ſtreſs of the Dr's Allegation depends, and which Mr. <hi>Bennet utterly denis;</hi> this certainly every Man muſt look upon <hi>as</hi> an <hi>utter</hi> Improbability. And as to <hi>that,</hi> Sir, upon which all depends, Mr. <hi>Crooke</hi>'s Certificate ſpeaks not a word. This Evidence therefore, I think, we may diſmiſs as frivolous and inſignificant. And notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s <hi>utterly</hi> denying it; yet I ſhall believe the Dr's contrary Affirmation, That Mr. <hi>Bennet did,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time or other <hi>ask</hi> the Dr's <hi>Opinion concerning the Book;</hi> which occaſioned the Dr's <hi>Reflection</hi> upon Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> and <hi>the</hi> Work <hi>he was about.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next after this Certificate of Mr. <hi>Crooke,</hi> Mr.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 128.</note> 
               <hi>Bennet</hi> gives in the date of a certain Letter of the Dr's own Hand-writing in Evidence againſt himſelf by the help of which, with a more
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:106337:108"/>than ordinary Aſſurance he borrows a <hi>Phraſe</hi> or two of the Dr's own to call him <hi>Lyar</hi> in: nay, and deſires the Reader, who is not capable of examining the <hi>Learned part of the Controverſie,</hi> to judge of That by the moſt palpable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors the Dr. is guilty of in plain matter of Fact; nay, and to place the matter beyond doubt, he tells us, that we ſhall in time have the Letter its ſelf Printed at large, and the Dr. confounded by the words of his <hi>own</hi> mouth.</p>
            <p>And who would imagine now,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 121.</note> to take my turn of borrowing a <hi>Phraſe</hi> from Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> but <hi>that a matter of Fact which he is ſo full of, ſhould really be as he has repreſented it?</hi> The Caſe indeed is ſomewhat puzzled, and would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more ſo, but that Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> I thank him, hath been at ſome Pains to unravel it, and in the ſame breath he accuſes the Dr. to acquit him.</p>
            <p>In the Dr's Preſace is this paſſage, p. 5, 6. <hi>The firſt time I ſaw Mr.</hi> Boyle<hi>'s new</hi> Phalaris, <hi>was in the hands of a Perſon of Honour, to whom it had been</hi> preſented, <hi>and the reſt of the Impreſſion was not</hi> yet <hi>publiſhed. This encouraged me to write that very ſame Evening to Mr.</hi> Boyle <hi>at</hi> Oxford, <hi>and to give him a true Inſormation of the whole matter; expecting that upon the Receipt of my Letter, he would put a ſtop to the Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Book, till he had alter'd that paſſage, and Printed the page anew, which he might have done in the ſpace of one day, and at the Charge of five Shillings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the Dr. mentions as an Aggravation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s injuſtice, that he would not <hi>alter that paſſage in his Preface,</hi> though he had <hi>time notice</hi> given him, how he had been impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:106337:108"/>by the Miſ repreſentations of his Bookſeller, and might have ſtop'd the farther ſpreading of that injurious Reflection; the Impreſſion being <hi>not yet</hi> diſperſed.</p>
            <p>Now, ſaith Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> this Story of the Dr's I <hi>ſhall demonſtrate to be a moſt</hi> notorious Falſhood <hi>by one of thoſe</hi> Notes of time, <hi>which the Dr him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well obſerves to be</hi> the trueſt and ſureſt Helps towards detecting Impoſtures. The Dr. pretends in this Letter, to have given Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> notice <hi>timely</hi> enough, <hi>to have</hi> altered <hi>that paſſage,</hi> and <hi>ſtop'd</hi> the Books in the Printing-houſe. Now, ſaith Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> this Letter, which is ſtill preſerved, bears Date <hi>Jan.</hi> 26th. 1694/5. a good while <hi>before which Mr.</hi> Boyle's <hi>Book was</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Publiſhed, and publickly ſold in</hi> Oxford, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and <hi>other poaces.</hi> The <hi>firſt of that Month above one hundred of them were diſperſed in</hi> Chriſti-Church, <hi>according to a Cuſtom which Dr.</hi> Bentley <hi>appears to be no ſtranger to; and in the twenty five days between this and the Date of the Letter they were diſtributed into</hi> all the <hi>Bookſellers hands that deal that way. And yet Dr</hi> Bentley <hi>would have the World believe, that he writ ſo early, that Mr.</hi> Boyle <hi>might have ſtop'd the Books in the Printing-bouſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer: The Dr. <hi>did</hi> know, that a good quantity of them were diſperſed in <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> and 'twas probably, one of thoſe <hi>New years Gifts</hi> that he ſaw in the hands of that perſon of Honour. But the <hi>reſt</hi> of the Impreſſion either was not publiſhed, or not ſo publiſhed as for the Dr. to know it. You ſay, they were diſtributed into <hi>all the</hi> Bookſellers hands that deal that way? I deny it? where are your <hi>Proofs?</hi> Here you ought to have come in with your Certificates. I do
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:106337:109"/>not <hi>believe</hi> that the Books were publickly Sold in the Shops till ſome time <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Date</hi> of this Letter. If otherwiſe, the Dr. muſt have been not only a <hi>Lyar,</hi> but a <hi>Fool;</hi> to deſire the Books to be ſtop'd <hi>in the</hi> Printing-houſe, when yet he <hi>knew,</hi> they were all got <hi>out</hi> of the Printing-houſe. Or how, and in what manner was the Book ſo publiſhed, as that the Dr. ſhould not know of the Publication? <hi>Quary,</hi> in which of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prints was the Publication of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles firſt <hi>Advertized?</hi> And when? was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Jan.</hi> 26th. 169 4/5? If not, what Proof have we that the Book was publiſhed before? <hi>Query,</hi> were the Copies <hi>ſo</hi> diſperſed, as that Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> had he been minded to do Juſtice, might not have printed one Page anew, and altered that paſſage in the Preface? If not, then Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> had notice <hi>early</hi> enough to have done it. Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> hath theſe words upon the Dr.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Indeed not only the Date,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 122.</note> 
               <hi>but the whole</hi> Courſe of <hi>the Letter is an evident Proof, that Dr.</hi> Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, <hi>when he writ it, could have no ſuch aim in his Eye as he pretends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query,</hi> What Aim could he have then? The Letter was written <hi>on purpoſe</hi> to deſire Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> to <hi>ſtop the Books in the Printing houſe;</hi> and yet the Dr. had <hi>no ſuch Aim in his Eye.</hi> This I cannot underſtand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why, that Letter all runs upon the Suppoſal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>that the Afffont had been publickly given, and was</hi> paſt <hi>recall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monſters! The Dr. writes a Letter to Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> the very Subject of which, was to deſire that Gentleman to <hi>recall</hi> the Affront: And yet all <hi>that Letter runs upon the Suppoſal, that the Affront was</hi> paſt <hi>recall. Theſe are Inconſiſtences,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106337:109"/>which if</hi> Mr. <hi>Bennet cannot reconcile, I dare ſay, No Body elſe can.</hi> I can ſay no more to this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, but that you are wanting in your <hi>Proofs:</hi> We have nothing but your bare word for it, that the Book was <hi>certainly Publiſhed and Sold publickly in</hi> Oxford, London, and other places before <hi>Jan.</hi> 26. Which till I ſhall ſee in what publick Prints the Publication of it was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd, I ſhall not be able to believe. Is it to be imagin'd, that the Dr. ſhould have written a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to deſire the <hi>ſtopping of the Books in the Printing-houſe,</hi> when yet he <hi>knew,</hi> that before his writing that Letter, they were all got <hi>out</hi> of the Printing-houſe? So that after all that Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, with which you deliver your Self upon this Article, either you have <hi>not</hi> proved the Dr. to be a <hi>Lyar,</hi> or you <hi>have</hi> proved him to be an <hi>Ideot.</hi>

               </note> upon a certain occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion not worth the repeating, had ſaid, <hi>That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was nominated to the Library-Keepers Office (before his Patent was finiſhed) he was informed,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106337:110"/>that one Copy of every Book Printed in</hi> England, <hi>which were due to the Royal Library by Act of Parliament, had not of late been brought into the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary according to the ſaid Act — upon which</hi> (paſſing by for Expedition ſake the reſt of the Story) <hi>he called upon Mr.</hi> Bennet, <hi>and demanded his ſhare towards it, which was then but very ſmall. But Mr.</hi> Bennet, <hi>inſtead of complying with the Demand, anſwered very pertly, That he knew not what Right the Parliament had to give away any Mans Property. The Company of</hi> Stationers <hi>were a Body, had a common Purſe, and he hop'd they would ſtand it out at Law,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>'Tis for the <hi>Diſproof</hi> of this Story, that Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> got this Certificate of the <hi>Beadle.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which let me only deſire the Reader to take particular Notice of, Firſt, this Expreſſion of it, <hi>Delivered in;</hi> and Secondly, the Date of the Year, when the Books were ſo <hi>Delivered in.</hi> In both which Particulars we ſhall find Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> guilty of a little ſlight of hand. The Books were <hi>Delivered in;</hi> but who is Mr. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s Deponent here ſpeaking of? of the King's <hi>Library-Keeper,</hi> I think. And what is he ſpeaking of? Of the King's Library. And where are we to underſtand theſe Books to have been <hi>Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in?</hi> Into the Royal Library! And when were they ſo <hi>Delivered in?</hi> before the 13th. Day of <hi>July,</hi> 1693. Very few Readers would underſtand this Certificate of the Beadle, in the Connexion it bears, and according to the occaſion for which it was produced, in any other meaning. But to our Surprize we find that none of theſe things were intended by Mr. <hi>Bennet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Appendix of Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s had not been long out e're he gets ſome inkling, that all the

Let the Reader, that thinks it worth his while, ſee the paſſage at large; and there he'll find, That neither is the <hi>Library-Keeper</hi> at S. <hi>James</hi>'s at all concerned in this Certificate of the <hi>Beadle,</hi> but the <hi>Treaſurer of the Stationers Company;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it the King's Library, the Books were <hi>Delivered into,</hi> but the <hi>Company's Ware-houſe;</hi> neither had the Dr. any Account of what Books were <hi>Delivered in,</hi> or from what hands they came, but the foreſaid <hi>Treaſurer:</hi> All this appears from Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s own <hi>Second</hi> Edition: The puzzling Account Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> had given of this Affair, and the Knowledge I had of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, put me indeed upon making ſome Enquiry into this Story about the Beadle. For ſeeing ſuch very unfair Dealings from the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> in all the reſt of this Controverſie; I made no doubt, but here was as much trick and faiſe Colour in this too, if I could but come at the Truth: And ſo indeed it prov'd; for a Friend of mine, of Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Trade, got me this following Certificate from the ſame Beadle, which I have now by me Sign'd by himſelf. Its conſiſtent indeed with what he depoſed before, but it will fully refute
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:106337:111"/>the falſe Inferences that Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> drew from it.</p>
            <p>September 12th. . . . . . . <hi>I Deliver'd to the Reverend Dr.</hi> Benthley, <hi>then Library-Keeper at St.</hi> James'<hi>s, a parcel of Books gather'd for the King's Library, and I never deliver'd any before, either to Him, or to any of his Predeceſſors; having been Beadle to the Company of Stationers ever ſince the 26th. of</hi> March 1692.</p>

            <p>The Reader may take notice, That the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is poſitive as to the day of the Month, <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 12th.</hi> when he deliver'd the Books at St. <hi>James</hi>'s: But he does not tell the Year. The Reaſon was, That he had entred the day of the Month in his Book of Accounts, but he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Year; and though he believes it was 1694, yet in his <hi>Affidavit</hi> he would affirms no farther, than he could be abſolutely ſure of. In which he acted like a Man of Conſcience; and if Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> had been as ſcrupulous in his own Teſtimonies, I dare ſay, this <hi>Phalaridan</hi> Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie had never been ſtarted. But however, as to the Year, when the Books were Deliver'd, we need to Teſtimony of the Beadle: for it could not poſſibly be before 1694. becauſe <hi>September 12th.</hi> 1693. Mr. <hi>Juſtel</hi> the Dr's Predeceſſor was ſtill alive, and no Succeſſor then named to him; and its certain from the Date of the Dr's Patent, and from ſeveral other authentick Teſtimonies, that he had no Power, nor Cuſtody of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary till above half a year after.</p>
            <p>Now to Examine Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Inferences from his Beadle's Certificate, and to compare them with this other from the ſame hand.</p>
            <pb n="203" facs="tcp:106337:111"/>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> had ſaid, <hi>That he was informed, that one Copy of every Book Printed in</hi> England, <hi>which was due to the Royal Library by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioment, had not of late been brought into the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary according to the ſaid Act. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this I made Application to the Maſter of the Stationer's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and demanded the Copies.

                  <hi>P.</hi> 114.</note> ſays he, <hi>Would be thought, to have firſt ſet a-foot this</hi> Collection <hi>due to the Royal Library;</hi> and again,<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 116.</note> 
               <hi>he Dr. ſays, he ſet about this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of getting the Books due to the King's Library, Collected; for ſo he would have us underſtand him.</hi> And this he diſproves, becauſe there was a <hi>Collection</hi> made in <hi>July</hi> before, 1693.</p>
            <p>Now this is ſo exactly like Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s way of refuting the Dr.; that one would be apt to ſuſpect, the ſame hand was employ'd in drawing up both that <hi>Examination,</hi> and this <hi>Appendix.</hi> The was is to Charge the Dr. with ſaying, what he never ſaid; and then to be ſure they muſt have a great meaſure of Dulneſs, if they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute what they invented on purpoſe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</p>
            <p>The Bookſeller has the Confidence to tell his Readers, <hi>That the Dr. would be thought to have</hi> Firſt <hi>ſet a-foot the Collection.</hi> And yet the Dr. in words as full as can be deſir'd, has plainly implied the contrary. For he tells us, <hi>The Books had not</hi> of late
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106337:112"/>
               <hi>been brought into the Library;</hi> which is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Proof, that he believed himſelf, and would have his Reader ſuppoſe, that they had <hi>formerly</hi> been brought in according to the Act. <hi>For</hi> the Act commenc'd ſoon after the Reſtauration of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. The Books therefore might have been gather'd for many years; and <hi>
                  <hi>yet</hi> of late</hi> have been neglected.</p>
            <p>We have one plain Falſhood then in the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller's Repreſentation of this matter; and we ſhall preſently have another. For he talks of the Dr's ſetting a-foot the <hi>Collection;</hi> and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of having the Books <hi>Collected; for ſo,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the dr. would have us underſtand him.</hi> How the Gentlemen of the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> are uſed to <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> the Dr's Writings, the World is now pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well ſatisfied: But if I may meaſure other Readers from my ſelf, I durſt be bold to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that not one of them could put that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon the Dr's words, unleſs he either careleſly read him, or wilfully miſ-repreſented him. For the Dr. whoſe words I have cited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, has not a Syllable about <hi>Collecting</hi> in all that paſſage: He only ſays, <hi>The Books had not been</hi> brought <hi>into the Library;</hi> which is true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yong Contradiction. But whether ſome or all of the Books had been <hi>Collected</hi> from the ſeveral Bookſellers, and laid up in the Stationers Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; that was more than he could pretend to know. He found, they were not in the Royal Library; and like an honeſt and careful Man, he did the Duty of his place, and took care to ſee them lodg'd there. And without ſuch a Care they might have lain long enough, before the King's Library had been the richer for them. But beſides all this, it will appear preſently, that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:106337:112"/>all the Books which were Printed from <hi>June</hi> 93, to <hi>April</hi> 94. might even be <hi>uncollected,</hi> as well as <hi>not brought in</hi> till the Dr. demanded them.</p>
            <p>After two ſuch notorious Stretches that the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller has made here in repreſenting the Dr's words, we may eaſily gueſs what will become of the reſt of what he has brought on this Head. He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to prove, <hi>That no ſuch Diſcourſe</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> when the Dr. ſays, He asked Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> to give his ſhare of Books to the King's Library, and Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> refuſed it) <hi>could happen between the Dr. and him;</hi> becauſe it appears by the Beadle, that <hi>Mr.</hi> Bennet <hi>complied to give his ſhare without any Diſpute whatſoever,</hi> July 13th. 1693. which was before the Dr. was nominated to his Office.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 116.</note> And <hi>the Act of Printing expiring about</hi> April, <hi>or</hi> May 1693.; <hi>after that time no Body could pretend to demand Arrears from particular Bookſellers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, if I had not been pretty well acquainted with the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> Sincerity, I ſhould have thought this Argument a ſtrong one, and very pinching upon the Dr. But beign fully perſwaded from the reſt of their management, that this too was all of a piece; I began to caſt about, if I could find any flaw in the Proof; and ſeeing the main of it depended upon the Act of Printing's <hi>expiring in</hi> May 1693; I fanſied the Deceit muſt needs lie in that Particular. I know, my Reader will think now, that this was a very unlikely Gueſs of mine; for how is it credible, that they would falſifie an act of Parliament, where any Body that had a mind to Examine the matter, might eaſily diſcover the Cheat? This I own, was ſomething choaking: For I argued ſo to my ſelf at that time; but however, ſince it came into my way, I was reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:106337:113"/>
               <hi>Keeble</hi> upon the <hi>Statute for Printing;</hi> and there I found,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Keeble's Statutes,</hi> p. 1658.</note> that the Act of Printing, when it was laſt revived, commenced from the 13th. of <hi>February</hi> 169 2/3, and from thence continued to the End of the next Seſſion of Parliament, which was <hi>May</hi> 1694.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader now reflect a little upon the Impudence of this Bookſeller, and thoſe that aſſiſted him; who, rather than ſay nothing againſt Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> would tell thus in the Face of the Sun the moſt palpable Falſhood. <hi>The Act of Printing,</hi> ſays he, <hi>expired in</hi> April <hi>or</hi> May, 1693. <hi>Therefore the Dr. could not demand Books of me after that time</hi> (as he ſays he did) <hi>upon that Act of Printing.</hi> But the contrary of this, Sir, is moſt evident from the Act it ſelf; for it did not expire till <hi>May</hi> 1694. And the Dr. ſays, that he demanded the Books of you, <hi>after be was nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to the Library-Keeper's Office, and before his Patent was finiſhed,</hi> that is, as you your ſelf cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate it;<note n="†" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ben.</hi> p. 113.</note> 
               <hi>ſometime</hi> between <hi>December 23d.</hi> (93) <hi>and April 18th.</hi> (94) ſo that he demanded the Books of you while the Statute was in force: And I make no doubt, but he did really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them of you, both becauſe it became one in his place to do ſo, and becauſe he made the ſame demand upon ſome other Bookſellers at the ſame time, and becauſe you do not offer to diſprove it, withiout telling ſuch manifeſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, as all the World may diſcover.</p>
            <p>But you think it utterly incredible, that you ſhould deny the Books to the King's Library up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Dr. <hi>B</hi>'s asking, when you had granted them <hi>without any Diſpute</hi> to the Beadle. Why, truly Sir, as you by falſifying an Act of Parliament have ſtated this matter, there appears ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:106337:113"/>on your ſide. For you make the Dr. and the Beadle demand them at or near the ſame time. But as Mr. <hi>Keeble</hi> has aſſiſted us to put the Caſe truly, there's nothing at all improbable in the Dr's Account of this Story. For you might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver ſome Books in <hi>June</hi> 1693. to the Beadle; and yet your Opinion, or your Humour might be chang'd before <hi>April 18th.</hi> 1694. You ſay, <hi>The Diſcourſe that the Dr. puts in your Mouth, is all over ſo abſurd and ſenſeleſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 118.</note> 
               <hi>that no Body that knows you will think you capable of it.</hi> But for me, that do not know you otherwiſe, than from your ſhare in this Controverſie, you'll excuſe me, if I think you <hi>capable</hi> of it, becauſe I find you actually guilty of worſe. And I perſwade my ſelf, that every Body elſe, if he take your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as I do, from the Papers that carry <hi>your Name, will be of my</hi> Opinion.</p>
            <p>As for that Honourable Gentleman, Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sherburn</hi>'s Letter, which he ſent to Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 134.</note> and ordered to be <hi>imediately Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the World;</hi> all that I ſhall preſume to ſay of it is this; that the Reader, who ſhall give himſelf the trouble of peruſing the Dr's<note n="*" place="margin">Praef. <hi>P. 46,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Account of the Matter of Fact, to which that Letter refers, will find it ſo well atteſted, that he will ſcarce know how to Charge the Dr. with <hi>Falſhood,</hi> without bringing ſome other very great Names under the ſame Suſpicion.</p>
            <p>And as for the Letter of the aforeſaid <hi>William King.</hi> J. C. D. of the <hi>Commons,</hi> a part of it tranſcribed, may ſerve you for Anſwer to the whole. <hi>'Tis reputable both to Men and Books to be ill ſpoken of by him, and a favourable Preſumption on their ſide, that there is ſomething in Both which may chance to recommend them to the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106337:114"/>reſt of the World.</hi> Witneſs, The <hi>Journey to London,</hi> The <hi>Dialogues of the Dead,</hi> and this Letter, all ſuppoſed to come from the ſame hand.</p>
            <p>The laſt of Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Teſtimonies the Reverence due to the Memory of the Dead, obliges me to forbear medling with.</p>
            <p>At the Entrance of my Examination of Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi>
